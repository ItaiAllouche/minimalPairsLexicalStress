1034-121119-0008 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0048 PREOCCUPIED AS MADAME DANGLARS HAD BEEN WITH THE OBJECT OF HER VISIT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM THESE UNDERLINGS APPEARED TO HER SO INSULTING THAT SHE BEGAN BY COMPLAINING OF IT

1040-133433-0012 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT A VERY SWEET SUBJECT NO ABOUT ME PETER NO MISSUS DARLING CAME TO THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0043 I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
1069-133699-0016 IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
1069-133699-0035 IT'S VERY TRUE I DID ENCOURAGE HIM AND THEN SHE ASKED IF HER COMPANION HAD LEARNED FROM MISTER GOODWOOD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IT WAS A CONCESSION TO HER CURIOSITY FOR SHE DISLIKED DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT
1069-133699-0040 SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
1069-133699-0046 IT SEEMED TO HER AT LAST THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO TAKE A BOOK FORMERLY WHEN HEAVY HEARTED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE WITH THE HELP OF SOME WELL CHOSEN VOLUME TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE ORGAN OF PURE REASON
1069-133699-0049 YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GAVE ME MY DISMISSAL AT ALBANY THREE MONTHS AGO I DID NOT ACCEPT IT I PROTESTED AGAINST IT YOU IN FACT APPEARED TO ACCEPT MY PROTEST AND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT ON MY SIDE
1069-133699-0052 I SHALL NEVER THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE I CAME TO ENGLAND SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE I COULDN'T STAY AT HOME AFTER YOU HAD GONE I HATED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN IT IF I LIKE THIS COUNTRY AT PRESENT
1069-133699-0053 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
1069-133709-0000 HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1081-125237-0048 AND AS THE ORANGE PARTISANS WERE EVERYWHERE CLAMOROUSLY ACTIVE THE ADMIRAL WAS SUSPECT IN HIS PLACE CORNELISZ WITTE DE WITH WAS APPOINTED A CAPABLE SAILOR BUT DISLIKED IN THE FLEET AS MUCH AS TROMP WAS BELOVED DE WITH EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH DE RUYTER
1081-125237-0051 FULL OF RESENTMENT THOUGH HE WAS AT THE BAD TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED TROMP WAS TOO GOOD A PATRIOT TO REFUSE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE OLD ADMIRAL AT THE HEAD OF ONE HUNDRED WARSHIPS PUT TO SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVOYING SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MERCHANTMEN THROUGH THE STRAITS
1081-125237-0082 TO INCREASE THE FLEET AND SECURE THE ACTIVE CO OPERATION OF DENMARK AND FRANCE BOTH FRIENDLY TO THE STATES BUT CROMWELL REALLY WANTED PEACE AND SHOWED HIMSELF READY TO YIELD ON CERTAIN MINOR POINTS BUT HE CONTINUED TO INSIST ON THE EXCLUSION OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0083 NOT TILL THE DUTCH ENVOYS HAD DEMANDED THEIR PASSPORTS DID THE PROTECTOR GIVE WAY SO FAR AS TO SAY HE WOULD BE CONTENT TO HAVE THE EXCLUSION GUARANTEED BY A SECRET ARTICLE WHAT FOLLOWED FORMS ONE OF THE STRANGEST CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF DIPLOMACY
1081-125237-0101 AND OVERRULED THEIR PROTEST THE ACT WAS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN PASSED AND WAS ON MAY FIFTH SENT TO VAN BEVERNINGH AND NIEUWPOORT WITH INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO DELIVER IT UNTIL CIRCUMSTANCES COMPELLED THEM TO DO SO
1088-129236-0004 ONE MUST NOT BE TOO OLD THE DELICIOUS FANCIES OF YOUTH REJECT THE LEAST SAVOR OF A MATURE PHILOSOPHY AS CHILLING WITH AGE AND PEDANTRY THEIR PURPLE BLOOM
1088-129236-0022 THE WORDS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT ARE NOT LIKE OTHER IMAGES WRITTEN IN WATER BUT AS PLUTARCH SAID ENAMELLED IN FIRE AND MAKE THE STUDY OF MIDNIGHT THOU ART NOT GONE BEING GONE WHERE'ER THOU ART
1088-129236-0030 INTO THE MOST PITIFUL AND ABJECT IT WILL INFUSE A HEART AND COURAGE TO DEFY THE WORLD SO ONLY IT HAVE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BELOVED OBJECT IN GIVING HIM TO ANOTHER IT STILL MORE GIVES HIM TO HIMSELF
1088-134315-0012 PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED
1088-134315-0018 TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
1088-134315-0024 THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
1088-134315-0025 KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
1098-133695-0000 AS IF THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN IN A POSITION TO APPEAL TO IT BUT IN FACT THE BRITISH PUBLIC REMAINED FOR THE PRESENT PROFOUNDLY INDIFFERENT TO MISS ISABEL ARCHER WHOSE FORTUNE HAD DROPPED HER AS HER COUSIN SAID INTO THE DULLEST HOUSE IN ENGLAND
1098-133695-0026 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
1098-133695-0028 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0048 AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
1098-133695-0063 LITTLE HOWEVER FOR THE PRESENT HAD COME OF HIS OFFERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN DELAYED TO CARRY THEM OUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE LABOUR OF PROVIDING FOR HIS COMPANION BY NO MEANS SO SEVERE AS TO REQUIRE EXTRANEOUS HELP
1116-132847-0020 THE YOUNG MAN GAZED AT HER IN SURPRISE COULD ANY ONE SO RICH AND SO BEAUTIFUL REALLY WISH TO BE HIS WIFE HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN AND BELLAH WAS FORGOTTEN AS HE ANSWERED A MAN WOULD BE MAD INDEED TO REFUSE SUCH AN OFFER I CAN ONLY ACCEPT IT WITH JOY
1116-137572-0005 IS THE OBJECT OF ONE'S WISHES AS DESIRABLE AS ONE HAD EXPECTED BECAUSE REALITY RARELY MEASURES UP TO IMAGINATION THE FIRST ANSWER IS ALMOST BOUND TO BE NO THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND THE FIRST EMOTION TENDS TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT
1116-137572-0006 REGARDLESS OF HAZY BUT OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS AND THE OBJECT POSSESSED WILL MORE THAN LIKELY TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE IMAGINATION PICTURED KNOWING THAT A FLEETING SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IS NOT PECULIAR TO ONE'S OWN MARRIAGE BUT LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ALL
1116-137572-0051 MARY MAY SOON LOSE COURAGE AND RELINQUISH HER WIFELY JOB OF HUSBAND IMPROVEMENT OR THE COMBINATION MAY BE REVERSED FRANKNESS MUST GO CLOTHED IN TACT STIFF MINDED PEOPLE WHO ARE FRANK ONLY WHEN ANGRY LOSE THEIR CASE BEFORE THEY PRESENT IT
118-124588-0013 BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
118-47824-0017 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
118-47824-0028 COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
1183-133256-0013 NOT SO IT IS ONLY A RUN DOWN CONDITION OF THE ROOTS OF THE HAIR JUST AS THE BODY GETS RUN DOWN BUT YOU SHOULD NOT PERMIT THIS IT IS NOT NECESSARY AND THIS NEEDLESS LOOK OF AGE IMPAIRS YOUR USEFULNESS AND POPULARITY IN SOCIETY AND BUSINESS GOLDEN RULE HAIR RESTORATIVE SIMPLY INVIGORATES THE ROOTS
1235-135883-0017 THE REMAINDER OF IT REPLIED SCHEHERAZADE IS MORE SURPRISING AND YOU WILL BE OF THIS OPINION IF THE SULTAN WILL BUT PERMIT ME TO LIVE OVER THIS DAY
1235-135883-0031 BUT GRIEVED ON THE OTHER WHEN HE REFLECTED ON HIS FATAL OATH WHEN HE REACHED HOME HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF PERFECT JOY BUT HE INSTEAD OF RETURNING THEIR CARESSES WEPT SO BITTERLY
1235-135884-0011 AND FINDING MYSELF MOVED WITH COMPASSION I COULD NOT FIND IN MY HEART TO GIVE HER A BLOW BUT ORDERED MY FARMER TO GET ME ANOTHER MY WIFE WHO WAS PRESENT WAS ENRAGED AT MY TENDERNESS
1235-135887-0025 I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS PHYSICIAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT TO BE A VILLAIN AND A TRAITOR IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF MEN YOU KNOW BY WHAT MEDICINE OR RATHER BY WHAT MIRACLE HE CURED ME OF MY LEPROSY
1246-124548-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE SHE TRIED TO BE CONTENT WHICH WAS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS SHE FANATICALLY CLEANED HOUSE ALL APRIL SHE KNITTED A SWEATER FOR HUGH SHE WAS DILIGENT AT RED CROSS WORK

1263-138246-0013 FOR THE PRESENT WE MUST OCCUPY OURSELVES WITH OUR DEPARTURE ARE WE NOT READY DOUBTLESS BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN TO DEADEN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE FIRST SHOCK
1263-139804-0022 PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
1263-141777-0006 TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP CLEARING WAS TO RISK CAPTURE BUT HE HAD TO KNOW RYNCH LOOKED WITH MORE ATTENTION AT HIS PRESENT SURROUNDINGS DEEP MOLD UNDER THE TREES HERE WOULD HOLD TRACKS THERE MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE
1263-141777-0008 RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
1263-141777-0010 ANOTHER OBJECT CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF THE LEAN TO SHELTER JUST AS ITS FELLOW WAS ON SENTRY DUTY IN THE TREE ONLY THIS ONE DID NOT HAVE THE SELF COLOR OF THE FOLIAGE TO DISGUISE IT FOUR LIMBED ITS LONG FOREARMS CURVED ABOUT ITS BENT KNEES

1334-135589-0015 AND NOT RECEIVING THE ASSISTANCE HE EXPECTED FROM THE SPANIARDS HE FELL BACK TO THE FRONTIERS OF CHAMPAGNE PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM PARIS EDWARD HAD RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTER EXPLAINING AWAY THE INTENDANT'S CONDUCT

1334-135589-0052 HE CAN NOT REFUSE IT PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES BROTHER REPLIED ALICE I DOUBT IF THE KING OR HIS COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO MAKE SO MANY DISCONTENTED
1334-135589-0057 WHY HAS HE REBUILT ARNWOOD HE IS NOT GOING TO SURRENDER MY PROPERTY AND MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THE HOUSE
1334-135589-0069 AND WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WERE NOT WITH HIM THEY HAD OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE OBJECT WE HAVE BEFORE REFERRED TO WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT ADVANCING TOWARD THE KING
1334-135589-0072 BUT LITTLE ALTERED EXCEPT HAVING GROWN TALLER AND MORE ROUNDED AND PERFECT IN HER FIGURE AND HER COURT DRESS DISPLAYED PROPORTIONS WHICH HER HUMBLE COSTUME AT THE NEW FOREST HAD CONCEALED OR WHICH TIME HAD NOT MATURED
1334-135589-0083 AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU

1355-39947-0030 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IF I HYPNOTIZE A MAN AND SUGGEST TO HIM TO TAKE UP AFTER AWAKING THE BOOK WHICH LIES ON MY TABLE HE FOLLOWS MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONFLICT AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WITHOUT FREEDOM HE FEELS A SIMPLE IMPULSE TO GO TO THE TABLE AND LIFT THE BOOK AND
1355-39947-0062 WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0070 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1363-139304-0042 THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH

150-126107-0026 SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING

1502-122615-0017 THE HURON WAS CONTENT WITH THE ASSURANCE AND RESUMING HIS PIPE HE AWAITED THE PROPER MOMENT TO MOVE THE IMPATIENT HEYWARD INWARDLY EXECRATING THE COLD CUSTOMS OF THE SAVAGES
1502-122615-0029 LIKE MOST AROUND HIM FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE HIS LOOK TOO WAS ON THE GROUND BUT TRUSTING HIS EYES AT LENGTH TO STEAL A GLANCE ASIDE HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS BECOMING AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTENTION
1502-122619-0004 THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
1502-122619-0005 THAT THEIR HATCHETS WERE DULL AND TIME WAS NECESSARY TO SHARPEN THEM THE POLITIC CAPTAIN OF THE CANADAS HAD DEEMED IT WISER TO SUBMIT TO ENTERTAIN A PASSIVE FRIEND THAN BY ANY ACTS OF ILL JUDGED SEVERITY TO CONVERT HIM INTO AN OPEN ENEMY
1502-122619-0011 AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
1502-122619-0012 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0015 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0023 NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
1502-122619-0033 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0074 AND THREE MEN ISSUING FROM IT SLOWLY APPROACHED THE PLACE OF CONSULTATION THEY WERE ALL AGED EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD TO WHICH THE OLDEST PRESENT HAD REACHED BUT ONE IN THE CENTER WHO LEANED ON HIS COMPANIONS FOR SUPPORT
1502-122619-0077 HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
1502-122619-0082 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0092 AND APPROACHING THE PATRIARCH THEY PLACED HIS HANDS REVERENTLY ON THEIR HEADS SEEMING TO ENTREAT A BLESSING THE YOUNGER MEN WERE CONTENT WITH TOUCHING HIS ROBE OR EVEN DRAWING NIGH HIS PERSON
1502-122619-0095 AROSE LEFT THE CROWD AND ENTERED THE LODGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AS THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THAT MORNING
1553-140048-0000 THEY DID NOT ACCOMPANY EACH OTHER TO THE DOORS OF THEIR CHOSEN VICTIMS FEELING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT APPROACH THE SUBJECT SERIOUSLY BUT THEY PARTED AT THE GATE OF EACH HOUSE THE ONE HOLDING THE HORSE WHILE THE OTHER TOOK THE SOAP SAMPLES
1553-140048-0003 OTHER STARS IN THEIR COURSES GOVERNED REBECCA'S DOINGS THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE INTERVIEWED EITHER REMEMBERED THEIR PRESENT NEED OF SOAP OR REMINDED THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD NEED IT IN THE FUTURE THE NOTABLE POINT IN THE CASE BEING
1553-140048-0009 SO SHE ASKED IS THE LADY OF THE HOUSE AT HOME I AM THE LADY OF THE HOUSE AT PRESENT SAID THE STRANGER WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE WOULD YOU LIKE OR I MEAN

1578-140045-0010 OF RECOLLECTION JOY AND DUTY HAD BEEN THE INSPIRING SUBJECT GIVEN TO THE OLDER CHILDREN FOR A THEME TO BE WRITTEN IN FIVE MINUTES REBECCA HAD WRESTLED STRUGGLED PERSPIRED IN VAIN WHEN HER TURN CAME TO READ
1578-140049-0014 AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT MUCH TO JANE'S GRATITUDE FOR SHE HAD BEEN NERVOUS AND ILL AT EASE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WHAT CHILD IN RIVERBORO COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE AND WINNING SAVE REBECCA WHAT CHILD HAD WONDERFUL EYES EXCEPT THE SAME REBECCA
1578-140049-0022 ON IT STOOD THE SACRED THE ADORED THE LONG DESIRED OBJECT ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AND NEARLY HALF AS LARGE AS THE ADVERTISEMENT THE BRASS GLISTENED LIKE GOLD AND THE CRIMSON PAPER SHADE GLOWED LIKE A GIANT RUBY
1578-140049-0035 HE NEEDED THE SOAP DREADFULLY AS A PRESENT FOR HIS AUNT MISS JANE STILL LOOKED A LITTLE UNCONVINCED THOUGH SHE ONLY SAID I HOPE YOUR AUNT MIRANDA WON'T MIND BUT YOU KNOW HOW PARTICULAR SHE IS REBECCA AND I REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY WITHOUT ASKING HER FIRST FOR YOUR ACTIONS ARE VERY QUEER
1578-6379-0040 EIGHT OTHERS FOLLOWED HER EXAMPLE AND THRILLED AT THE TOUCH IT WAS CALCULATED TO FIT A FAR LARGER PERSON THAN ANY PRESENT EVEN IRENE MC CULLOUGH FOUND IT BAGGY HE HAD AWFULLY BROAD SHOULDERS SAID ROSALIE STROKING THE SATIN LINING
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0065 THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
1594-135914-0069 WHEN GANEM WAS WITH YOU FETNAH WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED BUT THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS COMING IN INTERRUPTED HER MADAM SAID HE TO HER I COME FROM SEEING A VERY MOVING OBJECT IT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOM A CAMEL DRIVER HAD JUST CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL
1594-135914-0072 PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR CARE TAKEN OF HIM I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WAY OF MANAGING THE SICK AND AM SENSIBLE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE PHYSICIANS
1594-135914-0078 IT IS NOT YOU THAT I ADDRESS MY IMAGINATION BEING OVERCHARGED WITH YOUR IMAGE HAS GIVEN TO A STRANGER A DECEITFUL RESEMBLANCE

1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
163-122947-0038 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0064 THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0075 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0093 NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
1723-141149-0017 SUCCEEDED IN MAKING FAR MORE HIDEOUS GRIMACES THEY COULD REPEAT WITH PERFECT CORRECTNESS EACH WORD IN ANY SENTENCE WE ADDRESSED THEM AND THEY REMEMBERED SUCH WORDS FOR SOME TIME YET WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH APART THE SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
1723-141149-0025 WAS ONE CHIEF INDUCEMENT TO CAPTAIN FITZ ROY TO UNDERTAKE OUR PRESENT VOYAGE AND BEFORE THE ADMIRALTY HAD RESOLVED TO SEND OUT THIS EXPEDITION CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAD GENEROUSLY CHARTERED A VESSEL AND WOULD HIMSELF HAVE TAKEN THEM BACK THE NATIVES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A MISSIONARY
1723-141149-0038 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0039 AND JEMMY WHEN HE HAD ANY LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICER ON WATCH WOULD SAY ME SEE SHIP ME NO TELL IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE CONDUCT OF THE SAVAGES WHEN WE LANDED TOWARDS JEMMY BUTTON
1723-141149-0040 THEY IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND HELD MUCH CONVERSATION ONE WITH ANOTHER ON THE SUBJECT THE OLD MAN ADDRESSED A LONG HARANGUE TO JEMMY WHICH IT SEEMS WAS TO INVITE HIM TO STAY WITH THEM
1723-141149-0082 THEIR VOICES DISCORDANT AND THEIR GESTURES VIOLENT VIEWING SUCH MEN ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE ONE'S SELF BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE FELLOW CREATURES AND INHABITANTS OF THE SAME WORLD IT IS A COMMON SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE WHAT PLEASURE IN LIFE SOME OF THE LOWER ANIMALS CAN ENJOY
1723-141149-0110 AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
1737-142397-0006 ALWAYS STUCK STAUNCHLY TO A NEW FAD TILL HE HAD WORN IT QUITE OUT JUST AT PRESENT HE WAS A MUFFIN MAN
1737-142397-0021 A WEARY UNRHYTHMIC THING OF RISE AND FALL AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME A GENUINE UTTERANCE AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE ONE THING FITTING AND RIGHT AND PERFECT HUMANITY WOULD HAVE REJECTED IT WITH SCORN NATURE EVERYWHERE SINGING IN THE SAME KEY
1737-142397-0031 THEN I PASSED ON MY WAY I PROTEST I WAS NOT ON BILL'S SIDE BUT THEN NEITHER WAS I ON THE VICAR'S
1737-148989-0029 AND ONCE MINNA THREW HIM MONEY WHICH HE HUMBLY RECEIVED AS PART OF HIS PENANCE BEING MORBID ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS SINS HIS REWARD CAME SOONER THAN HE EXPECTED AND WAS GREATER THAN HE DESERVED HE THOUGHT THOUGH HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY WHEN HIS MASTER ONE DAY INFORMED HIM
1737-148989-0035 AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
1743-142912-0007 HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIM REDTAIL WAS A PERFECT GIANT BUT THIS SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SCRAPPER FOR THAT IS WHO IT WAS
1841-179183-0019 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1867-148436-0018 THE BOY FLUSHED SO RED THAT BY CONTRAST HIS STRAW COLOURED HAIR SEEMED POSITIVELY WHITE MAYBE YOU WANT TO PAY ME HE SUGGESTED FIERCELY MAYBE YOU THINK WE'RE SQUATTERS THAT RUN A HOTEL
1867-154071-0015 FOR NEVER HAD THE MINER SEEMED SO CLUMSILY BIG AND GAUNT NEVER HAD HIS CLOTHES SEEMED SO UNPRESSED AND SHAPELESS WHILE HIS SOFT GRAY HAT TO WHICH HE STILL CLUNG RELIGIOUSLY APPEARED HOPELESSLY OUT OF PLACE IN CONTRAST WITH THE SLIM PRETTINESS OF THE GIRL
1867-154071-0025 WHAT A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ASCENT AND THE DESCENT HE HAD LITERALLY FLOWN DOWN NOW HIS HEELS CLUMPED OUT A SLOW AND REGULAR DEATH MARCH AS HE CAME BACK TO THE ROOM WHEN GREGG OPENED THE DOOR
1867-154075-0031 THE PERFECT TORTURE WHICH HAD BEEN WRINGING THE SOUL OF THE MAN OF THE SNEER PROJECTED THROUGH THE LAUGHTER I ASK YOUR PARDON MY DEAR SAID JOHN MARK TO RUTH I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU FOUND HIM HE CONFESSED WHY HE WAS HERE YOU TOOK PITY ON HIM
1898-145715-0035 HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
1898-145715-0045 THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
1898-145715-0049 HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
19-198-0031 THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
19-227-0008 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0013 SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
19-227-0016 AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
19-227-0022 AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
19-227-0026 WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
19-227-0031 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0034 COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
19-227-0035 NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
19-227-0043 BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
1926-143879-0005 SINCE THE ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE WAS NOT THROUGH THE GARDEN IN WHICH STILLNESS AND PRIVACY ALWAYS REIGNED SHE WISHED RATHER TO FORESTALL HIS ARRIVAL BY A PROCESS OF CONJECTURE AND TO JUDGE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE THIS ATTEMPT GAVE HER PLENTY TO DO
1926-143879-0008 IF HER THOUGHTS JUST NOW HAD INCLINED THEMSELVES TO RETROSPECT INSTEAD OF FLUTTERING THEIR WINGS NERVOUSLY ABOUT THE PRESENT
1926-147987-0013 HER CRY OF FRIGHT AWAKENED ME TRULY I WAS A BATTERED OBJECT AS SHE HELPED ME TO MY ROOM I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR MY LIP WAS CUT AND STOOD OUT LIKE A SNOUT MY NOSE LOOKED LIKE A BIG BLUE PLUM
196-122150-0001 HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
1963-142393-0055 AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
1963-147036-0003 SHE DREW A CHAIR TO THE TABLE AND DROPPED HER FACE UPON HER HANDS AND HE STOOD BY EMBARRASSED ALMOST TERRIFIED BY THIS UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT SO YOU WERE THE VISITOR ON THE BICYCLE HE SAID AT LAST I DIDN'T SUSPECT
1963-147036-0029 LOCKS WILL PRESENT VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY
1970-10594-0003 UNDER HER GREAT DETERMINATION TO KEEP GWENDOLEN IN HER OWN CARE BUT WITH JUPP TO WATCH THE DOCK AND A MAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES AT THE DOOR OF THE SMALL HOTEL SHE WAS AT PRESENT BOUND FOR I THOUGHT I MIGHT REMAIN IN YONKERS CONTENTEDLY THE WHOLE DAY
1970-10594-0004 MISSUS CAREW AND THE CHILD WERE STILL AT THE ADDRESS SHE HAD GIVEN ME ALL LOOKED WELL IN THAT DIRECTION
1970-26100-0016 AND IS THE HEAD OF AN AEROPLANE FIRM BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS AN AEROPLANE HERE HE COULD GET ONE EASY ENOUGH THE CLEVER DEVIL LOOK OVER THERE HE HAD THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE GOLF COURSE AS A PERFECT LANDING GROUND
1970-26100-0034 ALMOST ANY ONE MIGHT BE ACCUSED SOME ONE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS WORRIED WE ALL KNEW SIR THAT MISTER FELDERSON AND MISTER WOODS WERE NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND MISTER WOODS LAUGHED AND SAID THAT FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PERFECT ALIBI
198-129977-0005 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0010 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0017 TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
198-129977-0026 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
198-209-0034 WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
1992-141719-0009 BEFORE THEY COULD BE ENTITLED TO THE ELECTION SO THAT THE TOURNAMENTS WERE TO BE CONTINU'D TILL ONE OF THE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE TWICE A VICTOR AND SHINE AS CONSPICUOUS WITH RESPECT TO HIS INTERNAL QUALITIES AS TO HIS DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS IN HEROIC ATCHIEVEMENTS
200-124139-0035 WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
200-124140-0007 AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
200-126784-0035 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
2002-139469-0001 AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0073 HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2007-132570-0007 WELL WELL SAID EMILY IMPATIENTLY AND ANXIOUS TO ENQUIRE ON ANOTHER SUBJECT
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0013 IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
201-127786-0031 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0080 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
211-122425-0027 THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
211-122425-0035 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0042 NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
211-122442-0026 IN A TINE OF PERFECT GOOD FELLOWSHIP WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU ALL THESE DAYS
211-122442-0045 AND KNOWS THAT I HAVE BEEN TO LONDON THE DEVIL YOU HAVE BEEN TO LONDON WAS IT FROM LONDON YOU BROUGHT THAT BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND THAT GLITTERS ON YOUR FINGER BEWARE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN A PRESENT FROM AN ENEMY IS NOT A GOOD THING
211-122442-0046 ARE THERE NOT SOME LATIN VERSES UPON THAT SUBJECT STOP YES DOUBTLESS REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
2136-5140-0038 AND INTERPRETED THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE AND AS DEAR PAPA ACCEPTED THEIR IDEAS I AM HAPPY IN THINKING THAT THEY DID NOT CONFLICT WITH THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF HOLY WRIT LEANING ON MY HAND I WAS NOW LOOKING UPON THAT SOLEMN WOOD
2136-5143-0005 THE MASTER SAYS YOU MAY HAVE THE BRANDY BOTTLE MADAME AND I'M GLAD TO BE RID OF IT I AM MADAME COURTESIED WITH A GREAT SMIRK THAT WAS FULL OF INTANGIBLE HATE AND INSULT BETTER YOUR OWN BRANDY IF DRINK YOU MUST EXCLAIMED MISSUS RUSK
2136-5147-0018 BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU MUST SEE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE I NEVER YOU KNOW REFUSE TO TAKE TROUBLE WHEN I AM ABLE NEVER NEVER AND MADAME SHED SOME TEARS WHICH ALWAYS CAME AT CALL
2159-179154-0014 AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
2159-179154-0019 BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
2159-179154-0022 HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
2159-179154-0027 THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
2159-179154-0029 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0033 DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
2159-179156-0000 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0020 THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0026 THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
2159-179156-0028 TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
2159-179156-0029 AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
2159-179156-0030 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0032 IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
2159-179156-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179157-0003 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0009 NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
2159-179157-0026 GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
2159-179157-0028 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2182-181173-0029 HE LOOKED AT THE PILES OF ROPE AT THE FURLED SAILS AT THE TALL TALL MASTS WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO TOUCH THE HOT BLUE SKY HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS FOR CONVERSING WITH THE SAILORS AND GAINING SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PIRATES
2182-181183-0013 SO NO MORE AT PRESENT DICK
2182-181183-0021 HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
2196-170151-0026 THE DEATH OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SEED IS THE PRELUDE TO ITS RESURRECTION AS WHEAT IT IS AT NIGHT IN THE DARKEST HOURS THOSE PRECEDING DAWN THAT PLANTS GROW BEST THAT THEY MOST INCREASE IN SIZE
2196-170151-0030 HAVE HAD THEIR SOURCE AND THEIR TRICKLING INCREASE INTO VOLUME AMONG THE DARK GLOOMY RECESSES OF OUR FAILURE THERE IS NO HONEST AND TRUE WORK
2196-170151-0033 THEY NEED NOT DISHEARTEN US THEY SHOULD PROVE SOURCES OF NEW STRENGTH THE ROCKY WAY MAY PROVE SAFER THAN THE SLIPPERY PATH OF SMOOTHNESS BIRDS CANNOT FLY BEST WITH THE WIND BUT AGAINST IT SHIPS DO NOT PROGRESS IN CALM
2196-170379-0000 IS TO EXPLORE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH ARE HELD BY LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRESENT IT CAN BE SAID HOWEVER THAT A MAJORITY OF AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT HYPNOSIS ENSUES AS A RESULT OF NATURAL LAWS
2196-170379-0007 IS CONVINCED THAT YOU CANNOT WILL YOURSELF TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND THAT WHENEVER THE WILL AND THE IMAGINATION COME INTO CONFLICT
2196-170379-0010 BUT WORDS WHICH RING A BELL OR TAP THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND OF THE SUBJECT
2196-170379-0012 ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT A STRONG INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY FOR HYPNOSIS IN THE OPENING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK I EXPLAINED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SUGGESTION IN WHICH THE SUBJECT ADOPTED AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE
2196-170379-0016 BUT WHY IS THIS HIGH ORDER OF CONCENTRATION SO EASY UNDER HYPNOSIS WHEN ASIANS NOTABLY THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR CENTURIES TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE SUBJECT FOR AS LONG AS FOUR OR FIVE SECONDS
2196-170379-0032 WHERE HYPNOTHERAPY IS IMPOSSIBLE LIKE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE MIND SLEEP AND MYRIAD THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND I BELIEVE ONCE A HYPNOTIC STATE HAS BEEN ATTAINED THAT THE SUBJECT IS KEPT AWAKE
226-122538-0005 JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
226-122538-0007 AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
226-122538-0025 YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
226-122538-0026 STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
226-131532-0008 OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0019 A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0022 THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
226-131533-0005 AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0009 AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0029 THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
2289-152257-0013 AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
2289-152258-0019 THREE WHEN MOHAMMED RETURNED HOME AFTER THE ANGEL HAD FIRST SPOKEN TO HIM HE TOLD HIS WIFE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD SHE AT ONCE BELIEVED AND SO BECAME A CONVERT TO THE NEW RELIGION
229-130880-0056 ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
229-130880-0063 THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
233-155990-0007 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0014 ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
233-155990-0027 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0032 RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
2384-152900-0045 THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0075 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2391-145015-0016 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0026 WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0037 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0058 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2416-152137-0004 INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
2416-152137-0006 OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
2416-152137-0018 THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
2416-152137-0023 POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
2416-152137-0032 MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
2416-152139-0036 WHEN YOU MUST HAVE MONEY OR FACE RUIN AND EXPOSURE YOU SAW IT THEN A YEAR AGO THE DAY THAT MOYNE CONCEALING NOTHING OF HIS PRISON RECORD APPLIED THROUGH FRIENDS FOR A POSITION IN THE BANK
2436-2476-0036 HE HAD COME INTO THE SALON WITH A SWAGGER HIS SWORD ORNAMENT CLANKING A PLEASANT VOYAGE SO FAR HE SAID TO ME AS HE STARTED HIS MEAL HIS VOICE HAD THE HEAVY THROATY RASP CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MARTIAN HE SPOKE PERFECT ENGLISH
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
250-140277-0004 AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142286-0006 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2518-154825-0016 YET IF THOU ART CONTENT TO HANG THY LIFE UPON A HAIR I WILL CARRY THEE SOME WAY AND WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM TO CARRY
2518-154826-0012 BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT
254-12312-0010 BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
254-12312-0017 SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
254-127705-0001 WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
254-127705-0004 TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
254-145458-0011 LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
26-495-0016 THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
26-495-0058 BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
2691-156745-0004 HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE IF YOU HAD DIED IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH YOUR DEAR MOTHER INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT ALONE TO STRUGGLE IN THIS WICKED WORLD THIS WOULD BUT INCREASE MY DISTRESS FOR I DID NOT WANT TO BE DEAD AND BURIED UP THERE UNDER THE COLD DEEP SNOW
2691-156745-0037 THEN LED US TO THE HOUSE WHERE A NUMBER OF PERSONS HAD GATHERED MOST OF THEM SITTING AT TABLE LAUGHING AND TALKING AND AMONG THEM ELITHA AND LEANNA UPON OUR ENTRANCE THE MERRIMENT CEASED AND ALL EYES WERE TURNED INQUIRINGLY TOWARD US
27-123349-0000 SOME OF THE SCOTTISH EMIGRANTS HEATED WITH REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM AND UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF THE SKILL NECESSARY TO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT AFFAIRS EMPLOYED ALL THEIR INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
27-123349-0043 WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
27-123349-0050 FOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THEIR EXPEDITION HOWEVER LANGUID AND IRRESOLUTE THEIR CONDUCT MIGHT BE THEY NEVER IN DEBATE WANTED SPIRIT OR PERSEVERANCE SOME WERE FOR AN ATTACK ON KIRKWALL
27-123349-0052 AFTER LOSING THREE DAYS SAILED AWAY THIS DELAY WAS FULL OF DANGER IT WAS SPEEDILY KNOWN AT EDINBURGH THAT THE REBEL SQUADRON HAD TOUCHED AT THE ORKNEYS TROOPS WERE INSTANTLY PUT IN MOTION
27-123349-0058 A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
27-124992-0020 AND BE SUBJECT TO THEE THAN TO DIE AND TO PERISH
2764-36616-0020 INCREASE ITS DIMENSIONS FIVEFOLD OR EVEN TENFOLD THEN GIVE THIS CETACEAN A STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE WHILE ENLARGING ITS OFFENSIVE WEAPONS AND YOU HAVE THE ANIMAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT WOULD HAVE THE PROPORTIONS DETERMINED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHANNON
2764-36617-0009 FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS CONSEIL HAD GONE WITH ME WHEREVER SCIENCE BECKONED NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF A JOURNEY NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO
2764-36617-0010 NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT MOREOVER HE ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH THAT DEFIED ALL AILMENTS OWNED SOLID MUSCLES BUT HADN'T A NERVE IN HIM NOT A SIGN OF NERVES THE MENTAL TYPE I MEAN
2764-36617-0038 IT HUGGED THIS SAND COVERED STRIP OF LAND WHERE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS ACCLAIMED US ONE MORE TIME THE ESCORT OF BOATS AND TENDERS STILL FOLLOWED THE FRIGATE AND ONLY LEFT US WHEN WE CAME ABREAST OF THE LIGHTSHIP WHOSE TWO SIGNAL LIGHTS MARK THE ENTRANCE OF THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
2764-36619-0003 ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED BY JULY THIRD WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
2764-36619-0037 COME ON CONSEIL I TOLD HIM HERE'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POCKET THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF MASTER WILL PERMIT MY SAYING SO CONSEIL REPLIED I NEVER EXPECTED TO WIN THAT PRIZE
2817-142371-0015 IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
2817-142371-0038 NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0040 HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
2817-142371-0047 BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0053 THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
2817-142371-0056 AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL
2817-142380-0033 ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0038 IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
2836-5354-0028 WE HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN CONGRATULATING YOU UPON YOUR ACCESSION TO THE TITLE AND ESTATES AND BEG TO STATE THAT SHOULD IT NOT BE CONVENIENT TO YOU TO VISIT ENGLAND AT PRESENT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO TRANSACT ALL NECESSARY MATTERS FOR YOU
2836-5354-0051 THAT MILADI WOULD SOON GET ABOUT IF SHE WOULD ONLY ROUSE HERSELF SHE HAD GOT SO FAR ABOUT AS TO SIT UP IN THE WINDY CHAMBER AND IT SEEMED TO BE TO HER A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE EVER GOT OUT OF IT
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0039 THE LAST OF THEM THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE SURFACE WAS NOW FINE ENOUGH SMOOTH AS A FLOOR AND WITHOUT A SIGN OF SASTRUGI IF OUR PROGRESS WAS NEVERTHELESS SLOW AND DIFFICULT THIS WAS DUE TO THE WRETCHED GOING
2843-152918-0048 LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
2843-152918-0074 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0091 AS WE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUR OBJECT WAS TO MAKE TRACKS FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY'S JOURNEY THE LANGUAGE WE USED ABOUT THE GLACIER AS WE WENT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLIMENTARY WE HAD ENDLESS TACKING AND TURNING TO GET ON
2843-152918-0112 WHICH LED ONE TO SUSPECT A CONTINUATION IN THAT DIRECTION THOUGH ONE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN MOUNT NILSEN AH ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL TAKING IT ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN
289-121652-0021 REPEATED RESEARCHES AT WORCESTER HAVING FAILED TO BRING TO LIGHT THIS SUPPOSED COPY AND NO RECORD OF IT APPEARING ON ANY CATALOGUE THERE WE MAY DISMISS THE ENTIRE STORY WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT MISTER ELIOT MISUNDERSTOOD THE REMARKS MADE TO HIM
289-121652-0031 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE NONE OF THE EARLIER EDITIONS HOWEVER CONTAINED ALL THE RHYMES SO WELL KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY SINCE EVERY DECADE HAS ADDED ITS QUOTA TO THE MASS OF JINGLES ATTRIBUTED TO MOTHER GOOSE
2910-131096-0006 INFUSE INTO THE BOSOM OF THAT HAUGHTY GIRL A PASSION FOR SOME LOW MEAN UNWORTHY BEING SO THAT SHE MAY REAP A MORTIFICATION AS GREAT AS HER PRESENT EXULTATION AND TRIUMPH CUPID PREPARED TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MOTHER
2910-131096-0019 BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
2910-131096-0054 AND SEE THAT YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE EVENING THEN VENUS DEPARTED AND LEFT HER TO HER TASK BUT PSYCHE IN A PERFECT CONSTERNATION AT THE ENORMOUS WORK SAT STUPID AND SILENT WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER TO THE INEXTRICABLE HEAP
2911-12359-0021 WAS A FAVORITE LIQUEUR OF CHEESE LOVING FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AND WE CAN BE SURE HE TOOK THE TWO SEPARATELY ANOTHER PERFECT COMBINATION IF YOU CAN TAKE IT
2911-15045-0009 AND WAVING WITH HARVESTS OF MAIZE FEAR TOO DROVE THEM EASTWARD FOR THE IROQUOIS PURSUED THEM WITH AN INVETERATE ENMITY SOME PAID YEARLY TRIBUTE TO THEIR TYRANTS WHILE OTHERS WERE STILL SUBJECT TO THEIR INROADS
2911-15084-0006 WHILE AS YET THE COLONIES OF ENGLAND WERE BUT A WEAK AND BROKEN LINE ALONG THE SHORE OF THE ATLANTIC AND WHEN AT LAST THE GREAT CONFLICT CAME ENGLAND AND LIBERTY WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED
2911-7601-0011 SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
2911-7601-0025 AND FELL FULL UPON THE VULTURE EYE IT WAS OPEN WIDE WIDE OPEN AND I GREW FURIOUS AS I GAZED UPON IT I SAW IT WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS ALL A DULL BLUE
2911-7601-0040 WITH PERFECT SUAVITY AS OFFICERS OF THE POLICE A SHRIEK HAD BEEN HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR DURING THE NIGHT SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY HAD BEEN AROUSED INFORMATION HAD BEEN LODGED AT THE POLICE OFFICE AND THEY THE OFFICERS
2952-407-0012 TO COMPARE TO LIKEN BUT THE ESOTERIC MEANING IS TO SUBSTITUTE IN IMAGINATION ONE OBJECT OR ACTION FOR ANOTHER SO AS TO BRING ABOUT SOME MAGICAL OR MIRACULOUS RESULT
2952-407-0015 SO MUCH WILL PERHAPS SUFFICE TO EXPLAIN THE RELIGIOUS MEANINGS OF NAZORAERU THE MAGICAL MEANINGS COULD NOT ALL BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT A GREAT VARIETY OF EXAMPLES BUT FOR PRESENT PURPOSES THE FOLLOWING WILL SERVE IF YOU SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE MAN OF STRAW
2952-408-0022 AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID REVEREND SIR THERE IS NO PRIEST AND THERE IS NO ANJITSU ON THE HILL FOR THE TIME OF MANY GENERATIONS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY RESIDENT PRIEST IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD MUSO SAID NOTHING MORE ON THE SUBJECT
2952-410-0045 BUT THE MAGISTRATES DID NOT LAUGH THEY JUDGED HIM TO BE A HARDENED CRIMINAL AND HIS STORY AN INSULT TO THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEREFORE WITHOUT FURTHER QUESTIONING THEY DECIDED TO ORDER HIS IMMEDIATE EXECUTION ALL OF THEM EXCEPT ONE
2952-410-0052 AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION FILLED THE COURT ROOM FOR THERE WERE MANY PRESENT WHO REMEMBERED IT AND KWAIRYO IMMEDIATELY FOUND HIMSELF AMONG FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JUDGES FRIENDS ANXIOUS TO PROVE THEIR ADMIRATION BY FRATERNAL KINDNESS
298-126790-0000 THE FAMILY AT THE LOCUSTS HAD SLEPT OR WATCHED THROUGH ALL THE DISTURBANCES AT THE COTTAGE OF BIRCH IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE THE ATTACKS OF THE SKINNERS WERE ALWAYS MADE WITH SO MUCH PRIVACY AS TO EXCLUDE THE SUFFERERS
298-126790-0030 UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
298-126790-0039 IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
298-126790-0043 I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
298-126791-0016 FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
298-126791-0028 A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
298-126791-0034 AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
2989-138028-0002 WHAT ANSWER GOD WILL GIVE TO YOUR COMPLAINTS HOUSEKEEPER I KNOW NOT NOR WHAT HIS MAJESTY WILL ANSWER EITHER I ONLY KNOW THAT IF I WERE KING I SHOULD DECLINE TO ANSWER THE NUMBERLESS SILLY PETITIONS THEY PRESENT EVERY DAY
2989-138028-0063 LET THIS NEW SAMSON REMAIN IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND BRINGING HONOUR TO IT BRING HONOUR AT THE SAME TIME ON THE GREY HEADS OF HIS VENERABLE PARENTS FOR I WILL BE CONTENT WITH ANY SQUIRE THAT COMES TO HAND AS SANCHO DOES NOT DEIGN TO ACCOMPANY ME
2989-138028-0068 SO I OFFER AGAIN TO SERVE YOUR WORSHIP FAITHFULLY AND LOYALLY AS WELL AND BETTER THAN ALL THE SQUIRES THAT SERVED KNIGHTS ERRANT IN TIMES PAST OR PRESENT
2989-138028-0074 WITH WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT
2989-138035-0060 SENOR IT'S MY OPINION THE POOR MAN SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH WHAT HE CAN GET
2989-138035-0078 DON QUIXOTE WAS WATCHING THE ENTRANCE AT ONE END OF THE ARCADE OF SOME TWELVE PEASANTS ALL IN HOLIDAY AND GALA DRESS
302-123504-0028 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123516-0010 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
307-127539-0004 AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
307-127539-0033 WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
307-127540-0015 A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
307-127540-0023 THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
311-124404-0026 TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
311-124404-0050 WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
311-124404-0110 AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
3112-9554-0022 NEARLY FIVE WEEKS FROM THE NIGHT OF HIS ATTACK I HAVE BEEN LED TO SAY THESE FEW WORDS NOT AT ALL FROM A DESIRE TO SUPPLEMENT MY FATHER'S BIOGRAPHY OF HIMSELF BUT TO MENTION THE MAIN INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS OWN RECORD
3112-9555-0031 I HAVE NO CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF HER OBJECT OR OF MY FATHER'S BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT MONEY MIGHT BE MADE BY SENDING GOODS LITTLE GOODS SUCH AS PIN CUSHIONS PEPPER BOXES AND POCKET KNIVES OUT TO THE STILL UNFURNISHED STATES
3112-9555-0034 THERE HAVE BEEN HOT WORDS BETWEEN US FOR PERFECT FRIENDSHIP BEARS AND ALLOWS HOT WORDS FEW BROTHERS HAVE HAD MORE OF BROTHERHOOD BUT IN THOSE SCHOOL DAYS HE WAS OF ALL MY FOES THE WORST
3112-9555-0058 THE ONLY EXPENSE EXCEPT THAT OF BOOKS TO WHICH A HOUSE BOARDER WAS THEN SUBJECT WAS THE FEE TO A TUTOR AMOUNTING I THINK TO TEN GUINEAS MY TUTOR TOOK ME WITHOUT THE FEE
3168-173565-0034 FOR SOME PURPOSE OR FOR SOME REASON BUT THE LOVE WHICH I WHILE DYING FIRST EXPERIENCED WHEN I SAW MY ENEMY AND YET LOVED HIM I EXPERIENCED THAT FEELING OF LOVE WHICH IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE AN OBJECT
32-4137-0007 FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
3214-167602-0004 AND CONTINUED TO IMPART HIS VIEWS HE SAID THE PEASANTS WERE OBDURATE AND THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO OVERRESIST THEM WITHOUT AN ARMED FORCE AND WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FIRST TO SEND FOR THE MILITARY I'LL GIVE THEM ARMED FORCE
3214-167602-0028 SAID HE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME AND WISHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
3214-167602-0035 AND THAT CAUSED HIS SISTER TO REFUSE MY BROTHER AND IN ALL THIS PRINCESS MARY SAW THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE THE IMPRESSION THE PRINCESS MADE ON ROSTOV WAS A VERY AGREEABLE ONE TO REMEMBER HER GAVE HIM PLEASURE
3214-167606-0016 COULD NOT BE FOUND WITHOUT SELLING ONE OF THE ESTATES IN GENERAL THE HEAD STEWARD MADE OUT TO PIERRE THAT HIS PROJECT OF RAISING A REGIMENT WOULD RUIN HIM PIERRE LISTENED TO HIM SCARCELY ABLE TO REPRESS A SMILE
3214-167607-0025 PROTECTED BY THE RIVER KOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOW NAPOLEON
322-124146-0014 MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
322-124146-0018 MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
322-124146-0021 WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
322-124146-0026 WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0033 HAD MY FAIR COUSIN HONOURED ME WITH HER HAND FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT RESIGNATION IS NEVER SO PERFECT AS WHEN THE BLESSING DENIED BEGINS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF ITS VALUE IN OUR ESTIMATION
322-124146-0035 MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
322-124146-0036 I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
322-124147-0011 BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
322-124147-0025 AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
322-124147-0035 AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
322-124147-0037 HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
322-124147-0039 AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
322-124147-0058 BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
3235-11599-0005 CETERA WHICH FORM THE ACTUAL MUSICAL CONTENT OF THESE GROUPS THE STUDENT WILL NOTE THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RHYTHM AND MEASURE RHYTHM IS THE REGULAR RECURRENCE OF ACCENT IN A SERIES OF BEATS OR PULSES
3235-11599-0028 BUT AN INCOMPLETE CIRCLE DIFFERENTIATING TWO BEAT IMPERFECT MEASURE FROM THREE BEAT PERFECT MEASURE
3235-28433-0003 WHERE HE COULD DO BEACH MINING I WAS NOT ABOVE DOING ANY HONEST WORK AND FELT CONFIDENT THAT I COULD MAKE MY WAY IF I COULD GAIN AN ENTRANCE INTO THAT COUNTRY THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE ALL WORKERS AND I HAD KNOWN THEM FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE
3235-28433-0046 THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH SNOW DOWN DEEP GORGES DASHED MOUNTAIN WATERS OF MELTING SNOW AND ICE HURRYING TO LEAP OFF GULLIED AND ROCKY CLIFFS INTO THE SEA THEIR PROGRESS WAS NEVER IMPEDED
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0073 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3242-67153-0028 I REMEMBER ONE PICTURE HE GOT OUT SHOWING SIXTEEN COWS STANDING BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LETTER PRESS AND TELLING HOW EVERY POUND OR SO OF GRAHAM'S EXTRACT CONTAINED THE JUICE SQUEEZED FROM A HERD OF STEERS IF AN EXPLORER STARTED FOR THE NORTH POLE
3242-67153-0029 JIM WOULD SEND HIM A CASE OF EXTRACT AND THEN ADVERTISE THAT IT WAS THE GREAT HEAT MAKER FOR COLD CLIMATES AND IF SOME OTHER FELLOW STARTED ACROSS AFRICA HE SENT HIM A CASE TOO AND ADVERTISED WHAT A BULLY DRINK IT WAS SERVED UP WITH A LITTLE ICE
3242-67153-0031 WHEN THE ORDERS FOR EXTRACT BEGAN TO LOOK UP AND HE GOT A REPRIEVE THEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE EXPENSES AND HE GOT A PARDON AND FINALLY A RUSH CAME THAT LEFT HIM HIGH AND DRY IN A PERMANENT PLACE
3242-67153-0037 I SIMPLY MENTION THIS IN PASSING I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ULTIMATE GOOD SENSE AND I GUESS YOU'LL SEE THE POINT WITHOUT MY ELABORATING WITH A MEAT AX MY REASONS FOR THINKING THAT YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH COLLEGE FOR THE PRESENT
3242-67168-0009 IT SEEMED LIKE A WORTHY OBJECT SO I SENT SOME CARPENTERS OVER TO KNOCK TOGETHER A LONG FRAME PAVILION SHE WAS MIGHTY GRATEFUL YOU BET AND I DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR A FORTNIGHT THEN SHE CALLED BY TO SAY THAT SO LONG AS I WAS IN THE BUSINESS AND THEY DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING SPECIAL
3242-67168-0012 GRAHAM'S EXTRACT IT MAKES THE WEAK STRONG
3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
3259-158083-0002 FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED
3259-158083-0022 USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
3259-158083-0069 WAS STRETCHED ON BED TWO DOCTORS MATRON FOUR COLORED PRISONERS PRESENT WHITTAKER IN HALL I WAS HELD DOWN BY FIVE PEOPLE AT LEGS ARMS AND HEAD I REFUSED TO OPEN MOUTH GANNON PUSHED TUBE UP LEFT NOSTRIL
3259-158083-0073 WITH MISS BURNS AND MISSUS LEWIS WHO WERE REGARDED AS LEADERS IN THE HUNGER STRIKE PROTEST REMOVED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL MISTER WHITTAKER AND HIS STAFF AT OCCOQUAN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO BREAK DOWN THE MORALE OF THE HUNGER STRIKERS
3259-158083-0083 MISTER TUMULTY ASSURED HER THAT THE WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CLOTHED AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE CLOTHING TO BE SENT THE SUBSEQUENT STORIES OF THE WOMEN SHOWED WHAT AGONIES THEY HAD ENDURED BECAUSE THEY WERE INADEQUATELY CLAD FROM THE DAMPNESS OF THE CELLS INTO WHICH THEY WERE THROWN
3259-158083-0089 AND PUT IT ON IN ORDER TO PREPARE MYSELF IF ATTACKED I WAS TREMBLING AT THE TIME AND WAS STUNNED WITH TERROR AT THE SITUATION AS IT HAD DEVELOPED AND SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT I WILL GIVE MY NAME UNDER PROTEST AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE DESK WHEREON LAY THE BOOKS THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOUTED TO ME
3259-158083-0101 INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
3259-158083-0118 AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
3259-158083-0122 WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
3374-298025-0013 THE ENJOYMENT YOU ARE SO EXTRAORDINARILY CLEVER DEAREST LUCINDA THAT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS LONG ERE THIS BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT THIS IS ALL NOTHING BUT A BEAUTIFUL DREAM
3374-298026-0010 A PERFECT FRIEND FOR IT WAS IN FRIENDSHIP ESPECIALLY THAT I SOUGHT FOR WHAT I WANTED AND FOR WHAT I NEVER HOPED TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN IN YOU I FOUND IT ALL AND MORE THAN I COULD WISH FOR
3374-298026-0017 LIKE OUR LOVE ARE IMMORTAL I CAN NO LONGER SAY MY LOVE AND YOUR LOVE THEY ARE BOTH ALIKE IN THEIR PERFECT MUTUALITY MARRIAGE IS THE EVERLASTING UNITY AND ALLIANCE OF OUR SPIRITS
3374-298026-0022 SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF AS SINGLE AND INDIVISIBLE AS A PERSON ONE THING CROWDS OUT ANOTHER AND THAT WHICH JUST NOW WAS NEAR AND PRESENT SOON SINKS BACK INTO OBSCURITY
3374-298026-0033 THE POIGNANT GRIEF WOULD BE TRANSIENT AND QUICKLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO COMPLETE HARMONY HOW COULD SEPARATION SEPARATE US WHEN PRESENCE ITSELF IS TO US AS IT WERE TOO PRESENT
3374-298032-0007 I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
3374-298032-0017 AND THEN PRESENT YOURSELF AGAIN WHEN YOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
3374-298032-0019 AND FOR THAT REASON I SUSPECT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HAVE ALREADY IMPARTED MY SUSPICION TO YOU THAT THE NEXT LIFE WILL BE LARGER AND IN THE GOOD AS WELL AS IN THE BAD STRONGER WILDER BOLDER AND MORE TREMENDOUS
3436-172162-0027 THAT HE SHOULD TAKE HIM IN AND CONVEY HIM AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE FOR A LIBERAL REWARD THE CARTER CONSENTED AND SIR LAUNCELOT PLACED HIMSELF IN THE CART AND ONLY LAMENTED THAT WITH MUCH JOLTING HE MADE BUT LITTLE PROGRESS
3436-172162-0041 AT LENGTH HIS PROGRESS WAS CHECKED BY A WIDE AND RAPID TORRENT WHICH COULD ONLY BE PASSED ON A NARROW BRIDGE ON WHICH A FALSE STEP WOULD PROVE HIS DESTRUCTION LAUNCELOT LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND MAKING HIM SWIM BY HIS SIDE
3436-172171-0061 AND TRULY HE IS THE KNIGHT WHO FOUGHT WITH THEE LAST VERILY SAID PERCEVAL I AM NOT SORRY TO HAVE THUS AVENGED THE INSULT TO THE SMILING MAIDEN THEN PERCEVAL TOLD HIM HIS NAME AND SAID
3440-171006-0007 SHE SHED MANY TEARS OVER IT IN SECRET AND VERY MANY AND VERY EARNEST WERE THE PRAYERS SHE OFFERED UP FOR HER DEAR FATHER'S CONVERSION SHE WAS SITTING ON HIS KNEE ONE EVENING IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHILE HE AND SEVERAL OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE CONVERSING ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION
3440-171006-0011 HE STOPPED REMARKING YOUR LITTLE GIRL LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT WHAT IS IT MY DEAR ELSIE BLUSHED HESITATED AND LOOKED AT HER FATHER YES SPEAK MY DAUGHTER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY ELSIE LIFTED
3440-171006-0018 AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
3440-171009-0013 A VARIETY OF STORY BOOKS TOYS AND GAMES HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR THEIR AMUSEMENT ELSIE'S ENTRANCE WAS HAILED WITH DELIGHT FOR SHE WAS A GENERAL FAVORITE OH ELSIE CAN'T YOU TELL US WHAT TO PLAY CRIED MARY LESLIE I'M SO TIRED
3440-171009-0045 BLUSHES ARE VERY BECOMING OH YOU NEEDN'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE HANDSOME YOU'RE A PERFECT LITTLE BEAUTY DO TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET SUCH SPLENDID EYES BUT I NEEDN'T ASK FOR I HAVE ONLY TO LOOK AT YOUR FATHER TO SEE WHERE THEY CAME FROM
3440-171009-0046 MISTER DINSMORE TO ELSIE'S PAPA WHO JUST THEN CAME TOWARD THEM YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY PROUD OF THIS CHILD SHE IS THE VERY IMAGE OF YOURSELF AND A PERFECT LITTLE BEAUTY TOO
3440-171009-0065 MISSUS DINSMORE AND ADELAIDE APPROACHED THE TREE AND BEGAN THE PLEASANT TASK OF DISTRIBUTING THE GIFTS EVERYTHING WAS LABELLED AND EACH AS HIS OR HER NAME WAS CALLED OUT STEPPED FORWARD TO RECEIVE THE PRESENT NO ONE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN EACH HAD SOMETHING
3440-171009-0068 AND WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER PAPA'S PROMISED PRESENT WHEN SHE HEARD HER NAME AGAIN AND ADELAIDE TURNING TO HER WITH A PLEASED LOOK SLIPPED A MOST BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND RING ON HER FINGER FROM YOUR PAPA SHE SAID
3440-171009-0079 FOR THOUGH I TOO AM FOND OF SWEET THINGS I WILL NOT EAT THEM WHILE I REFUSE THEM TO YOU DO PAPA SHE URGED IT WOULD GIVE ME PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ENJOYING IT NO DARLING I WILL WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW TOO
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0038 HORSEMEN SPEARSMEN PIKEMEN A FULL THOUSAND OF THEM AT MY RIGHT WERE THE SCATTERED COMPANY THAT HAD COME FROM THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE THREESCORE OR MORE THERE SEEMED A SPELL UPON THEM
3526-175658-0001 WHEN EVENING CAME I PREPARED TO STEP OVER IN ORDER TO SEEK A CONFERENCE WITH MADEMOISELLE HERSELF ON THE SUBJECT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PAY THE VISIT BEFORE HAVING BEEN ALL DAY CLOSELY OCCUPIED IN CLASS
3526-175658-0005 WITH SUNK DARK EYES UNDER A LARGE SQUARE FOREHEAD COMPLEXION DESTITUTE OF BLOOM OR ATTRACTION SOMETHING YOUNG BUT NOT YOUTHFUL NO OBJECT TO WIN A LADY'S LOVE NO BUTT FOR THE SHAFTS OF CUPID
3526-175658-0024 SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE
3526-175658-0027 THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE
3607-135982-0003 EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
3607-135982-0050 HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
3607-29116-0002 AND THE SENATOR BEAMED WITH HIS OWN CONGRESSIONAL WIT IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE THINGS ARE WORKING VERY WELL WE HAVE MADE EVER SO MUCH PROGRESS IN A WEEK I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER COULD RUN THIS GOVERNMENT BEAUTIFULLY UNCLE THE SENATOR BEAMED AGAIN
3607-29116-0005 IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WASN'T IN IT HE SHOULD SUSPECT THERE WAS A FRAUD ON THE GOVERNMENT HE SAID THAT DID HE YES AND HE SAID HE FELT HE COULDN'T VOTE FOR IT HE WAS SHY NOT SHY CHILD CAUTIOUS HE'S A VERY CAUTIOUS MAN
3607-29116-0026 UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3664-178366-0015 I FOUND I HAD ACCEPTED INVITATIONS TO DINE AT HALF A DOZEN OR MORE HOUSES ON THE SAME DAY AND AT THE SAME HOUR JAMES GORDON BENNETT HAD PREPARED A DINNER FOR ME AT WHICH QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS WERE TO BE PRESENT
3664-178366-0026 AND OF COURSE I WAS PRESENT ON THE OPENING NIGHT A PRIVATE BOX HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ME THE THEATER WAS PACKED EVERY SEAT BEING OCCUPIED AS WELL AS THE STANDING ROOM THE DRAMA WAS PLAYED SMOOTHLY AND CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0027 THE AUDIENCE UPON LEARNING THAT THE REAL BUFFALO BILL WAS PRESENT GAVE SEVERAL CHEERS BETWEEN THE ACTS AND I WAS CALLED ON TO COME OUT ON THE STAGE AND MAKE A SPEECH
3699-19401-0005 THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
3699-19401-0016 THOUGH I PERCEIVE FROM A GLOW IN MY CHEEK THAT I BLUSH AS I BEGIN TO SPEAK TO THEE UPON THE SUBJECT AS WELL KNOWING NOTWITHSTANDING THY UNAFFECTED SECRECY HOW FEW OF ITS OFFICES THOU NEGLECTEST
3699-19401-0023 THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
3699-19401-0024 WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
3699-47246-0032 STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
3723-171115-0042 NOBODY COULD BE PERSUADED TO WITHHOLD THEIR RIGHT HAND FROM SLAUGHTER BUT THEY SLEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES LIKE MADMEN THEN IT WAS THAT ANTIGONUS WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO HIS FORMER OR TO HIS PRESENT FORTUNE CAME DOWN FROM THE CITADEL
3723-171115-0043 OR LET HIM GO FREE BUT PUT HIM INTO BONDS AND KEPT HIM IN CUSTODY THREE BUT HEROD'S CONCERN AT PRESENT NOW HE HAD GOTTEN HIS ENEMIES UNDER HIS POWER
3723-171631-0011 WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE CARE OF OUR OWN PRESERVATION TO LOOK FIRST TO OURSELVES FOR THEREFORE DOTH THE PHYSICIAN INTERMIT THE PRESENT CARE OF BRAIN OR LIVER
3723-171631-0012 BECAUSE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY SUBSIST THOUGH THERE BE NOT A PRESENT AND A PARTICULAR CARE HAD OF THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THEY CAN SUBSIST IF THE HEART PERISH
3723-171631-0034 WISE HEARTS IN ONE PLACE AND IN ANOTHER IN A GREAT DEGREE WISE PERFECT HEARTS STRAIGHT HEARTS NO PERVERSENESS WITHOUT AND CLEAN HEARTS NO FOULNESS WITHIN
3723-171631-0036 THE LAST ARE NOT HEARTS TO BE GIVEN TO THEE WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT THAT PRESENT I CANNOT BE THY SON AND I HAVE IT NOT TO THOSE OF THE FIRST KIND THOU GIVEST JOYFULNESS OF HEART

3723-171631-0055 ART ABLE TO MAKE THIS PRESENT SICKNESS EVERLASTING HEALTH THIS WEAKNESS EVERLASTING STRENGTH AND THIS VERY DEJECTION AND FAINTNESS OF HEART A POWERFUL CORDIAL
374-180298-0004 NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
374-180299-0008 AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
374-180299-0026 AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
3807-4923-0005 THE BOLD PROJECT SO BOLDLY AVOWED SEEMED TO HIM A SHEER ABSURDITY THE DANDY AND A CREW OF NINE CONVICTS NAVIGATE A BRIG ROUND THE WORLD PREPOSTEROUS WHY NOT A MAN ABOARD COULD WORK A RECKONING
3807-4923-0018 AND REX DARED NOT VENT HIS PASSION ON SO HELPLESS AN OBJECT AS MEN DO IN SUCH CASES HE VEILED HIS ANGER BENEATH AN AFFECTATION OF AMUSEMENT IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT MOVED BY THE TAUNT HE SMILED UPON THE TAUNTER MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN EVER
3807-4923-0027 LOOKING UP HE SAW CHESHIRE'S SAVAGE FACE AND HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LOCK AS HE COCKED HIS PIECE THE TWO SOLDIERS EXHAUSTED BY THEIR LONG PULL MADE NO EFFORT TO STAY THE PROGRESS OF THE BOAT
3807-4923-0037 AND A LOADED MUSKET ACROSS HIS KNEES THE WHITE OBJECT WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE MEN IN THE WHALE BOAT WAS A LARGE WHITE SHAWL WHICH WRAPPED MISSUS VICKERS AND SYLVIA
3807-4923-0041 FELL PINIONED AS HE WAS HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND RUSSEN PULLED HIM ROUGHLY TO HIS FEET WITH A COARSE LAUGH IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND THAT LAUGH GALLED HIM WORSE THAN HIS BONDS
3807-4923-0042 POOR MISSUS VICKERS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INSTINCT SAW THIS AND EVEN AMID HER OWN TROUBLE FOUND LEISURE TO CONSOLE HIM THE WRETCHES SHE SAID UNDER HER BREATH AS FRERE WAS FLUNG DOWN BESIDE HER TO SUBJECT YOU TO SUCH INDIGNITY
3807-4955-0031 GOIN A HOYSTERIN SIR SAID ONE OF THE CREW WITH A GRIN AS BLUNT THREW A BUNDLE INTO THE STERN SHEETS STAPLES THRUST HIS TONGUE INTO HIS CHEEK THE OBJECT OF THE VOYAGE WAS NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CAREFULLY PICKED CREW
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
3857-180923-0020 THERE ARE NOT A FEW OTHER NAMES UPON THE ROLLS OF THE REGIMENT WHICH UPON MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT CASE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE LIST
3857-180923-0025 THOUGH THE LARGE ADDITION TO ITS NUMBERS WHICH THE INCREASE IN SIZE NECESSITATED MADE IT PERHAPS SOMEWHAT LESS HOMOGENEOUS THAN AT FIRST IT DID NOT GREATLY ALTER ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
3857-182315-0034 DARWIN SAID THE ANT'S BRAIN WAS ONE OF THE MOST MARVELOUS ATOMS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE BRAIN OF MAN YES OF PRESENT DAY MAN WHO FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS HAD SO MUCH MORE CHANCE TO DEVELOP HIS BRAIN
3857-182317-0010 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0018 THE ELEPHANT IS STUPID WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING HOW TO USE TOOLS SO ARE ALL OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR OWN ISN'T IT STRANGE A TOOL IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE SENSE IS ANY OBJECT LYING AROUND
3857-182317-0025 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3879-173592-0002 WHO IT WAS PRETENDED COULD MUSTER THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND WARRIORS AND WHO PROMISED WITH THE AID OF A HUNDRED ARQUEBUSIERS TO CONQUER ALL THE KINGS OF THE ADJACENT MOUNTAINS AND SUBJECT THEM AND THEIR GOLD MINES TO THE RULE OF THE FRENCH
3879-174923-0006 HE WOULD NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO THINK HOW HE MIGHT IN SUCH CASE BEST BESTOW HIMSELF FOR THE PRESENT HE WOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE REGION OF POLITICS AND LIVE AS NEAR AS HE COULD TO THE WHIRL OF THE WHEEL OF WHICH THE SOUND WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
3879-174923-0041 THE IDEA OF A STATE CHURCH SAID PHINEAS IS OPPOSED TO MY THEORY OF POLITICAL PROGRESS WHAT I HOPE IS THAT MY FRIENDS WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I ATTACK THE PROTESTANT CHURCH BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC IF I WERE A PRIEST
39-121914-0003 THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
39-121914-0010 AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
39-121914-0045 AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
39-121914-0046 AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
39-121915-0028 HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
39-121916-0013 BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
39-121916-0031 AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
3947-13260-0025 THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0001 SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
3947-13262-0026 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
3982-182255-0007 NOT ARGUMENTATIVELY OR WITH ANY HEAT BUT WITH THE REFLECTIVE SADNESS THAT STEALS OVER AN ELDERLY MAN WHEN HE SITS IN THE LEATHER ARMCHAIR OF A COMFORTABLE CLUB SMOKING A GOOD CIGAR AND MUSING ON THE DECADENCE OF THE PRESENT DAY
3982-182255-0015 IT THRILLED HIM HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT IT STAYED IN HIS MEMORY AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY BUT AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE HERE MISTER DICK OVEREND SADLY NODDED ASSENT IN ADVANCE TO WHAT HE KNEW WAS COMING
3982-182255-0016 AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE WELL MISTER NEWBERRY HAD HAD HE SAID OCCASION TO VISIT THE STATE CAPITAL A WEEK BEFORE IN CONNECTION WITH A RAILWAY BILL THAT HE WAS TRYING TO THAT IS THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO
3982-182255-0031 AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE SLUGGISHNESS AND IGNORANCE OF THE SOUTH IN THE WEST THEY SPOKE OF IT AS A REVOLT AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST AND IN THE EAST THEY CALLED IT A REACTION AGAINST THE LAWLESSNESS OF THE WEST BUT EVERYWHERE THEY HAILED IT AS A NEW SIGN OF THE GLORIOUS
3983-5331-0008 WITH ITS SUBSTANTIAL SALARY SUFFICIENT FOR HIS AMBITION AND MANAGER HE HAD BEEN TO THEM WHEN THE PRESENT MISTER CARLYLE WAS IN LONG PETTICOATS HE WAS A SINGLE MAN AND OCCUPIED HANDSOME APARTMENTS NEAR
3983-5371-0000 NOW MISS CORNY IN SO SPEAKING HAD CERTAINLY NO THOUGHT OF PRESENT AND IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE GENTLEMAN BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE MOB AROUND HAD THE MOTION WAS COMMENTED BY THOSE STOUT SHOULDERED LABORERS
3983-5371-0022 WHO OR WHAT WAS THAT OBJECT IN ADVANCE OF IT SUPPORTED BETWEEN DRAKE AND THE LAWYER AND LOOKING LIKE A DROWNED RAT HAIR HANGING LEGS TOTTERING CHEEKS SHAKING AND CLOTHES IN TATTERS
3983-5371-0057 YES SIR HE CROSSED THE HALL ON HIS ENTRANCE TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE TORE UPSTAIRS TO HER CHAMBER AND SANK DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEARS AND DESPAIR OH TO LOVE HIM AS SHE DID NOW TO YEARN AFTER HIS AFFECTION WITH THIS PASSIONATE JEALOUS LONGING
40-121026-0031 HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
40-121026-0038 YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
40-222-0000 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
40-222-0018 AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
40-222-0035 FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
40-222-0040 SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
40-222-0047 BUT HENRY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH AND SOMETHING IN WHICH MISS THORPE'S NAME WAS INCLUDED PASSED HIS LIPS HOW QUICK YOU ARE CRIED CATHERINE YOU HAVE GUESSED IT I DECLARE AND YET WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN BATH
40-222-0064 I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT BUT WE MUST NOT IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS UNDERVALUE YOURS YOU FEEL I SUPPOSE THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA
4014-186176-0001 THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186179-0018 IN THE EASTERN PART OF FRANCE THEY CAME UPON ACTUAL WAR IN ALL ITS FATEFUL PROGRESS WITH WHOLE TOWNS DEMOLISHED FORESTS AND ORCHARDS BLOTTED OUT STARK RUIN WRITTEN OVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH
4014-186179-0020 BY THIS TIME THEY WERE WELL WITHIN SOUND OF THE HEAVY GUNS AND THEIR DRIVER TOLD THEM THAT THE ARTILLERY DUEL THEN GOING ON HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AT LEAST
4014-186179-0034 YOU WILL SEEK A SUITABLE LOCATION FROM WHICH TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS YOU WILL DETERMINE WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE BY WIRELESS AS SOON AS YOU CAN DO SO REPORT WHAT PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE USE EVERY CAUTION FOR YOU WILL BE IN THE COUNTRY OCCUPIED BY THE ENEMY
4018-103416-0000 THE WINTER WHICH PRECEDED THE ENTRANCE OF THE UNITED STATES INTO THE WAR WAS SOCIALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE IT WAS MARKED BY AN ALMOST FEVERISH GAYETY AS THOUGH HAVING APPARENTLY DETERMINED TO PURSUE A POLICY DICTATED PURELY BY SELF INTEREST
4018-103416-0030 SHE IGNORED HIS PROTEST AS SHE ALWAYS IGNORED PROTESTS AGAINST HER OWN METHODS OF HANDLING MATTERS I'M ACCUSTOMED TO IT WAS HER SOLE REPLY BUT HER RESIGNED VOICE BROUGHT HER AS IT ALWAYS HAD
4018-103416-0038 AND SHE HAD HELPED HIM OUT OF A HOLE JUST NOW ALL RIGHT I PROMISE HE SAID AT LAST BUT YOU'RE WORRYING YOURSELF FOR NOTHING MOTHER SHE WAS QUITE CONTENT THEN CHEERED AT ONCE CONSULTED THE JEWELLED WATCH ON HER DRESSING TABLE
4018-107312-0000 THE CHIEF STREET OF MOWBRAY CALLED CASTLE STREET AFTER THE RUINS OF THE OLD BARONIAL STRONGHOLD IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS AS SIGNIFICANT OF THE PRESENT CIVILIZATION OF THIS COMMUNITY AS THE HAUGHTY KEEP HAD BEEN OF ITS ANCIENT DEPENDENCE
4018-107312-0008 BY NARROW ARCHWAYS LIKE THE ENTRANCE OF HIVES SO LOW THAT YOU WERE OBLIGED TO STOOP FOR ADMISSION WHILE ASCENDING TO THESE SAME STREETS FROM THEIR DANK AND DISMAL DWELLINGS BY NARROW FLIGHTS OF STEPS
4018-107338-0026 THERE CAN BE OTHER THAN ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT A THOUSAND SAID MORLEY WE HAVE ALREADY AS MANY PARTIES AS IN SAINT STEPHEN'S ITSELF YOU TERRIFY ME SAID SYBIL I KNEW WE HAD FEARFUL ODDS TO COMBAT AGAINST
403-128339-0017 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0032 AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
403-128339-0033 HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
403-216-0000 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0003 BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
403-216-0007 AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
403-216-0008 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0018 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0020 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
405-130894-0052 AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
405-130895-0005 THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
4051-10927-0014 BUT JUDGING BY THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE COMPANY EVERYONE OBSERVED THAT YOUR CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WHAT COULD BE DESIRED I POSITIVELY DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE DOESN'T CARE SHE THOUGHT
4051-11218-0024 YOU WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MEDEA TRUE THE GOLDEN FLEECE MAY NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT THEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD AND ONE MUST NEEDS HAVE AN OBJECT YOU KNOW COME YOUR NIGHT'S WORK HAS BEEN WELL PERFORMED
4051-11218-0030 AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
4088-158077-0007 WE WERE UNITED ON NO OTHER SUBJECT SOME WOULD OFFER PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO THE WAR OTHERS WOULD BECOME DEVOTED FOLLOWERS OF A VIGOROUS MILITARY POLICY BETWEEN THESE EVERY SHADE OF OPINION WAS REPRESENTED EACH WAS LOYAL TO THE IDEAS WHICH SHE HELD FOR HER COUNTRY
4088-158077-0009 THE THOUSAND DELEGATES PRESENT AT THE CONVENTION THOUGH DIFFERING WIDELY ON THE DUTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN WAR WERE UNANIMOUS IN VOTING THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR WOMEN AND FOR THAT ALONE
4088-158077-0024 BUT THIS CONFLICT OF WITS AND BRAINS AGAINST POWER ONLY ENHANCED OUR INGENUITY ON THE DAY THE ENGLISH MISSION HEADED BY MISTER BALFOUR AND THE FRENCH MISSION HEADED BY M VIVIANI VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE WE TOOK THESE INSCRIPTIONS TO THE PICKET LINE
4088-158077-0037 ADVISING AN IMMEDIATE REPORT ON THE SUFFRAGE RESOLUTION AS HAVE ASKED FOR THE CREATION OF ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO REPORT ON THE SUBJECT HE MADE NO MENTION OF HIS STATE BY STATE CONVICTION HOWEVER AS HE HAD IN PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS
4088-158077-0038 AND THE COMMITTEE OF PROGRESSIVES UNDERSTOOD HIM TO HAVE AT LEAST TACITLY ACCEPTED FEDERAL ACTION THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO ACT AND THE HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE STEADILY REFUSED TO CREATE A SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0047 BUT MERELY REFLECTED THE PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT IT EXTRACTED THE OFFICIAL FLAVOR AND SO OF COURSE NO ACTION FOLLOWED IN CONGRESS AND SO IT WENT LIKE A GREAT GAME OF CHESS
4088-158077-0052 FOOD CONSERVATION OR WHAT NOT WOMEN FROM UNEX PECTED QUARTERS SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT THEIR PROTEST AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF MEASURES SO VITAL TO WOMEN WITHOUT WOMEN'S CONSENT COUPLED WITH AN APPEAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN
4088-158077-0071 CAN BE CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR PROTEST IS THEREFORE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOT WITH THE WOMEN OF AMERICA IF THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME WEAKENS THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158077-0079 NEWS HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY THAT THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED A MODERATELY LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED TO SEE THE FUN ONE HAS ONLY TO COME INTO CONFLICT WITH PREVAILING AUTHORITY WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY TO FIND FRIENDLY HOSTS VANISHING WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
4088-158077-0095 AND REPORTERS NOT TO ENCOURAGE US IN OUR PECULIAR CONDUCT BY PRINTING DEFIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN WHEN FLAUNTED ON A PRETTY LITTLE PURPLE AND GOLD BANNER AND EXHORTS THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL ITS THRILLS
4088-158079-0002 AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
412-126975-0039 IN THE LARGE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS AMPLE ROOM EVEN FOR SIR LEOPOLD AND THE REMOVAL OF HIS WRAPS PORCH AND VESTIBULE INDEED
412-126975-0042 STILL SEEMED STRUGGLING WITH PORTIONS OF HIS WELL LINED ATTIRE AND AT LENGTH PRODUCED FROM A VERY INTERIOR TAIL COAT POCKET A BLACK OVAL CASE WHICH HE RADIANTLY EXPLAINED TO BE HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HIS GOD DAUGHTER
412-126975-0075 HAVEN'T KILLED A POLICEMAN LATELY BLOUNT FROWNED THOUGHTFULLY A SPACE AND THEN SMOTE HIS THIGH YES WE CAN HE CRIED I'VE GOT FLORIAN'S ADDRESS HERE
4137-11701-0010 FATHER WILL MAKE YOU A PROPER PRINCE DIRECTLY HE COMES BACK WILL HE THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING YOU SEE HE DOESN'T KNOW YET ABOUT OUR LITTLE PRESENT TO THE COUNTESS BUT IT IS QUITE TIME WE GOT BACK TO BELVANE WE HAVE LEFT HER ALONE TOO LONG
4137-11701-0014 THE PRINCESS AND CORONEL WERE UPON THEM AH COUNTESS I THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND YOU TOGETHER SAID HYACINTH ARCHLY LET ME PRESENT TO YOU MY FRIEND THE DUKE CORONEL
4137-11702-0014 HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND ADDRESSED HIS TROOPS MEN OF EURALIA CHEERS WE HAVE RETURNED FROM A LONG AND ARDUOUS CONFLICT CHEERS TO THE EMBRACES LOUD CHEERS
4137-11702-0035 NO MATTER DEAR WE CAN EASILY FIND YOU PLENTY MORE SUITORS INDEED THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN VERY NEAR MY THOUGHTS LATELY WE'LL ARRANGE A LITTLE COMPETITION AND LET THEM KNOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES THERE'LL BE NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
4160-11549-0023 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME AN ACTUAL APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN MADE IN HER PRESENCE YES MY DEAR SAID MISS ELIZABETH AGAIN I SHALL FEEL THE SEPARATION VERY DEEPLY BUT IT MUST BE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR EACH OTHER THAT I SHOULD BE A VERY WICKED SELFISH OLD WOMAN TO THROW ANY OBSTACLE
4160-11549-0034 AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE A SUBJECT UPON WHICH I WISH TO ASK YOUR UNBIASED OPINION MY DEAR THEODORA BEFORE I SAY GOOD BYE WHEN A MAN FINDS HIMSELF IN A DANGER WITH WHICH HE CANNOT COMBAT AND REMAIN HUMAN
4160-11550-0001 IT WAS MIDNIGHT AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY SPENT IN BROOME STREET THAT THE RECORD WAS MADE AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH SHUT THE BOOK WITH A STARTLED FEELING THAT SHE HAD SHUT WITHIN ITS PAGES AN UNFINISHED PAGE OF HER LIFE IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO HAVE COME UPON HER SO SUDDENLY
4160-11550-0007 AND AT SEVENTEEN ONE DOES NOT COMPREHEND THAT FATE CAN BE WHOLLY BITTER OR THAT SOME TURN IN FORTUNE IS NOT IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER HOPELESS THE PRESENT MAY SEEM IN THIS MOOD THE ENTRY WAS MADE IN THE LITTLE JOURNAL AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH CRIED A LITTLE HOPED A LITTLE
4160-11550-0008 AND WONDERED GUILELESSLY HOW MATTERS COULD END WITH PERFECT JUSTICE TO PRISCILLA GOWER THE HOUSEHOLD SEEMED RATHER QUIET AFTER THE CHANGE MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS A MAN TO BE MISSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEO WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MISSED HIM
4160-11550-0013 WAS WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD PAMELA'S LOVE STORY MENTIONED SHE WAS SITTING AT WORK NEAR THEM WHEN THEO CHANCED TO MENTION ARTHUR BRUNWALDE AND TO HER SURPRISE PRISCILLA LOOKED UP FROM HER DESK IMMEDIATELY HE WAS YOUR SISTER'S LOVER WAS HE NOT SHE SAID WITH AN ABRUPT INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT
4160-14187-0008 YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL SURELY I SAID NO OF COURSE NOT HE REPLIED BUT WITHOUT MUCH CONVICTION AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO PURSUE THE MATTER WHEN POLTON REAPPEARED AND MY FRIEND ABRUPTLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT AFTER DINNER I RECOUNTED MY CONVERSATION WITH WALTER HORNBY
4160-14187-0011 IN WHICH CASE THE DEPRECIATION WOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED HIM IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT MIGHT HAVE A CONSIDERABLE BEARING ON THE PRESENT CASE MIGHT IT NOT UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THORNDYKE IT MIGHT BEAR ON THE CASE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
4160-14187-0020 THE FINGER PRINT IS A MOST VALUABLE CLUE AS LONG AS ITS EVIDENTIAL VALUE IS NOT EXAGGERATED TAKE OUR PRESENT CASE FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT THE THUMB PRINT THE ROBBERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ANYBODY THERE IS NO CLUE WHATEVER
4160-14187-0021 QUITE REPLIED THORNDYKE I HAVE ENTERTAINED IT FROM THE FIRST AND THE NEW FACTS THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED INCREASE ITS PROBABILITY YOU REMEMBER I SAID THAT FOUR HYPOTHESES WERE POSSIBLE THAT THE ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED EITHER BY REUBEN BY WALTER BY JOHN HORNBY OR BY SOME OTHER PERSON
4195-17507-0019 FOR HE WILL PERMIT NO REPROACH TO LIE ON HIS BELOVED LAND BUT THE TRAVELLER FREQUENTLY BECOMES DISCOURAGED AND THE AMERICAN CONTINGENT ESPECIALLY
4195-17507-0040 THAT IS IF YOU PERMIT ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU
4195-186236-0005 LOUISE AND BETH HAVING AT LAST FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR COUSIN'S DESIRE TO INCREASE THEIR BEQUESTS WERE OPENLY VERY GRATEFUL FOR HER GOOD WILL ALTHOUGH SECRETLY THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO RESENT PATSY'S CHOICE OF THE BOY AS THE PROPER HEIR OF HIS UNCLE'S FORTUNE
4195-186237-0021 THE MAJOR COUGHED AND TURNED THE LAMP A LITTLE HIGHER YOU'LL FIND THE AIR FINE AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD RESPECTABLE HE SAID TO TURN THE SUBJECT OUR MODEST APARTMENTS ARE COOL IN SUMMER AND WARM IN WINTER AND REMARKABLY REASONABLE IN PRICE

4267-287369-0005 EVERYONE TALKING DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE MEAL ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AND THE RATHER WEIRD CULMINATION OF IT WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS SO FAR ADMITTED TOM
4267-287369-0022 AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN OPPRESSIVENESS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS NOW QUITE DARK SAVE WHEN THE FITFUL LIGHTNING FLASHES CAME AND THEY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE BRILLIANTLY FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN BY CONTRAST
4267-72637-0005 AND WRITE UP A RECORD OF OUR ENTIRE TRIP FROM WINCHESTER WHILE THE IMPRESSIONS WERE FRESH IN MY MIND
4267-72637-0031 I DID NOT FACILITATE THE PREPARATIONS AND A MOMENT OF AWKWARD SILENCE ENSUED MIGHT I INQUIRE I ASKED IF THE DEAR LITTLE PERSON AT PRESENT REPOSING IN MY ARMS WILL STAY THERE WITH INTERVALS FOR REST AND REFRESHMENT
4267-78186-0031 AND AS STRONG AS A TOW BOAT I GUESS HE WAS SOMEWHAT LESS THAN A FOOT LONGER THAN THE MORAL LAW AND CATECHISM TOO HE WAS A PERFECT PICTUR OF A MAN YOU COULDN'T FAULT HIM IN NO PARTICULAR HE WAS SO JUST A MADE CRITTER
4297-13006-0002 THERE HAD HOWEVER BEEN A FEW WORDS SPOKEN ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN MISSUS ROBY AND HER NIECE WHICH HAD SERVED TO PREPARE EMILY FOR WHAT WAS COMING LOPEZ HAS BEEN TO YOUR FATHER
4297-13006-0009 RATHER EXCEEDING THE AVERAGE PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS HEIGHT OF WOMEN HER FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HANDSOME AND HER FORM WAS PERFECT BUT IT WAS BY HER MANNER AND HER VOICE THAT SHE CONQUERED RATHER THAN BY HER BEAUTY
4297-13006-0019 HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
4297-13006-0032 THAT HE MIGHT BE FIRM AGAINST HER I DON'T THINK THAT IT BECOMES YOU TO ASK YOUR FATHER SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO DO THE BEST I CAN FOR MY CHILDREN I AM SURE IT IS
4297-13009-0005 MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
4297-13009-0013 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0020 THIS ALSO THE NEWSPAPERS PERCEIVED AND HAVING SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION BEEN VERY LOUD IN EXPOSING THE DISGRACEFUL COLLAPSE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COULD HARDLY REFUSE THEIR SUPPORT TO ANY ATTEMPT AT A FEASIBLE ARRANGEMENT
4297-13009-0029 AND SO I TOLD THE DUKE HE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF YOUR MEN I THINK HE'S RIGHT THERE SAID ROBY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A FAIR DIVISION INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE CONTENT BUT THE PARTY WOULD BE DISSATISFIED
4297-13009-0049 AND FREE FROM BONDS BY WHICH THEY ARE CRAMPED AND CONFINED OF COURSE SUCH A TURN OF CHARACTER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DANGERS OF ITS OWN THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DANGERS THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHEN I SEE HER GRACE I SHALL TELL HER WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER
4340-15220-0008 AND IMMINENT DANGER OF GETTING EYES OR TEETH KNOCKED OUT THORNY WAS AN EXCELLENT PLAYER BUT NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH TO SHOW HIS PROWESS HE MADE BEN HIS PROXY AND SITTING ON THE FENCE ACTED AS UMPIRE TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT
4340-15220-0009 BEN WAS A PROMISING PUPIL AND MADE RAPID PROGRESS FOR EYE FOOT AND HAND HAD BEEN SO WELL TRAINED THAT THEY DID HIM GOOD SERVICE NOW AND BROWN WAS CONSIDERED A FIRST RATE CATCHER
4340-15220-0011 BUT HER HEROES WOULD NOT HAVE HER AT ANY PRICE AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH SITTING BY THORNY AND WATCHING WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST THE VARYING FORTUNES OF OUR SIDE A GRAND MATCH WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY BUT WHEN THE CLUB MET
4362-15663-0013 AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
4362-15663-0025 THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
4362-15663-0072 HE FIRMLY REFUSED TO MAKE THE VENTURE TO FIND THE CAMP WHILE I AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY ATTEND OUR EFFORTS AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS PRESENT PERIL DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIM OUR DISCUSSIONS ENDED
4362-15663-0079 SOME CRYSTALS LANDED WITH THEIR RAYS ALMOST PERFECT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE WORN AND BROKEN BY STRIKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR BY ROLLING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THESE SNOW FLOWERS IN CALM WEATHER IS INFINITELY GENTLE GLINTING SWAYING
4362-15663-0098 THE SUMMIT RIDGE WAS FORTUNATELY WIND SWEPT AND NEARLY BARE SO WE WERE NOT COMPELLED TO LIFT OUR FEET HIGH AND ON REACHING THE LONG HOME SLOPES LADEN WITH LOOSE SNOW WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS SLIDING AND SHUFFLING AND PITCHING HEADLONG
4397-15678-0019 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4406-16882-0015 AND THE DISMALNESS OF THE PRESENT NIGHT MY THOUGHTS RAN UPON MY LOSSES AND SAD BEREAVED CONDITION ALL WAS GONE MY HUSBAND GONE AT LEAST SEPARATED FROM ME HE BEING IN THE BAY AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE INDIANS TOLD ME THEY WOULD KILL HIM AS HE CAME HOMEWARD
4406-16882-0017 AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY
441-128982-0008 HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
441-128982-0035 EVEN IF HE COULD NOT WALK NO ATHLETE OF THE PRESENT DAY NO MATTER IF HE SHOULD BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED CIRCUS MAN COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO PERFORM THE FEAT WHICH THIS BOLD PIRATE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR FIVE OR SIX LEAGUES HE WENT THROUGH THAT MANGROVE FOREST
441-128988-0014 BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
441-130108-0005 ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
4441-76250-0029 I WANT YOU TO ASK HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THE PARTY I GAVE ON SUNDAY LAST DID YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND DO AS I TELL YOU SHE'LL BE JEALOUS AND ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WERE PRESENT OF COURSE YOU WEREN'T FOR THERE WAS NO PARTY YOU'LL BOTH EXPRESS DISCONTENT
4441-76262-0011 FALANDER OPENED AT ONCE AND ADMITTED AGNES WITHOUT A LOOK AT THOSE PRESENT SHE DREW THE KEY FROM THE LOCK AND LOCKED THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE A MOMENTARY EMBARRASSMENT SEIZED HER WHEN ON TURNING ROUND SHE WAS CONFRONTED BY TWO MEN INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE
4441-76262-0022 I HARDLY SLEPT A WINK WHAT BOOK WAS THAT ASKED REHNHJELM WITHOUT BETRAYING VERY MUCH INTEREST ITS TITLE WAS PIERRE CLEMENT AND ITS SUBJECT THE USUAL WOMAN'S GAME
4441-76263-0005 WITH ITS ROTTEN FLOOR AND LEAKING ROOF THE LATTER DEFECT WAS NOT FELT AT PRESENT
4441-76263-0017 QUITE TRUE I'M GOING TO LECTURE THERE ON SUNDAY NEXT ON SWEDEN A GOOD SUBJECT PLENTY TO SAY IF I SHOULD FALL ASLEEP ON YOUR SOFA DON'T WAKEN ME I'M DEAD BEAT ALL RIGHT OLD CHAP GO TO SLEEP A FEW MOMENTS LATER OLLE WAS FAST ASLEEP AND SNORING LOUDLY
4441-76263-0027 MISCREANT TO HAVE A PERFECT TIMBER YARD AND NOT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT IT THE RAIN'S DONE IT I DON'T CARE WHO'S DONE IT LET'S LIGHT A FIRE HE WRENCHED OFF A FEW PIECES OF WOOD WITH HIS STRONG HANDS AND SOON A FIRE WAS BLAZING IN THE GRATE
445-123857-0018 WHAT OLD DECEMBER'S BARENESS EVERYWHERE AND YET THIS TIME REMOVED WAS SUMMER'S TIME THE TEEMING AUTUMN BIG WITH RICH INCREASE BEARING THE WANTON BURDEN OF THE PRIME
445-123860-0005 THY RECORD NEVER CAN BE MISS'D THAT POOR RETENTION COULD NOT SO MUCH HOLD NOR NEED I TALLIES THY DEAR LOVE TO SCORE THEREFORE TO GIVE THEM FROM ME WAS I BOLD
445-123860-0007 THY REGISTERS AND THEE I BOTH DEFY NOT WONDERING AT THE PRESENT NOR THE PAST FOR THY RECORDS AND WHAT WE SEE DOTH LIE
446-123501-0020 MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
446-123501-0055 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0016 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
4481-17498-0003 LEST I BE ACCUSED OF UNDUE SENSATIONALISM IN RELATING THE SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC SICILIAN INCIDENT I WILL ASSURE MY READER THAT THE STORY DOES NOT EXAGGERATE PRESENT CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND IN FACT IL DUCA AND TATO
4481-17498-0034 AND WHERE BY INDUSTRY AND PERSEVERANCE I CAN SCATTER SOME OF MY ILL GOTTEN GAINS THE MAJOR SMILED GRIMLY THAT'S EUROPE RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID AND I DON'T OBJECT JOHN TO YOUR GOING THERE WHENEVER YOU PLEASE YOU'RE DISGRACEFULLY COUNTRYFIED
4481-17499-0009 YOU AND BETH SHALL GO ANYHOW AND WE'LL BRING LOUISE A WEDDING PRESENT WITH THIS DECLARATION HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WALKING STICK AND STARTED FOR THE TELEGRAPH STATION LEAVING PATSY AND HER FATHER TO CANVASS THE UNEXPECTED SITUATION
4481-17499-0045 JUST TELL HER THE NEWS AND HELP HER TO GET READY ON TIME AND NOW I'M OFF GOOD MORNING MARTHA SHE REALLY HAD NO WORDS OF PROTEST READY AT HAND AND IT WAS LONG AFTER QUEER OLD JOHN MERRICK HAD GONE AWAY THAT SHE REMEMBERED A DOZEN EFFECTIVE SPEECHES THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED
458-126290-0009 AS THE CHILD HAS A WHITE RING ROUND ITS NECK I CANNOT REFUSE THE GOOD MOUSE CONSENTED BUT THE CAT CREPT BEHIND THE TOWN WALLS TO THE CHURCH AND DEVOURED HALF THE POT OF FAT NOTHING EVER SEEMS SO GOOD AS WHAT ONE KEEPS TO ONESELF
460-172357-0018 IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0058 A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
460-172359-0087 THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
4640-19187-0026 THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19189-0002 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0005 OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0035 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4680-16026-0001 WHICH SHE HAD NOT YET DONE UP TO THAT TIME SHE HAD CONTENTED HERSELF WITH WATCHING HIM ON HIS PASSAGE ALONG THE BOULEVARD WITHOUT EVER SEEKING TO ENCOUNTER HIM IT WAS ONLY ON THE EVENING BEFORE THAT SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS HIM
4680-16041-0007 NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ARBRE SEC THERE WERE ASSEMBLAGES MOTIONLESS AND GLOOMY GROUPS WHICH WERE TO THOSE WHO WENT AND CAME AS STONES IN THE MIDST OF RUNNING WATER AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
4680-16042-0021 CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR
4680-16042-0024 THE ONE IS THE DEFENDER THE OTHER THE LIBERATOR SHALL WE BRAND EVERY APPEAL TO ARMS WITHIN A CITY'S LIMITS WITHOUT TAKING THE OBJECT INTO A CONSIDERATION THEN NOTE THE INFAMY OF BRUTUS MARCEL ARNOULD VON BLANKENHEIM COLIGNY HEDGEROW WAR
4788-294466-0008 PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ONLY ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN I AM AND I REFUSE TO BE CALLED ELDERLY MARY SMILED FAINTLY BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS STILL THINKING OF THE PAST WHEN SHE HAD BEEN A LITTLE GIRL WITH GOLDEN CURLS THAT HUNG TO HER WAIST A WONDERFULLY PRETTY WISTFUL LITTLE GIRL
4788-294466-0025 BUSTIN BRONCS MARY SMILED IN APPRECIATION OF THE OLD MAN'S JOKE NO JERRY WON'T EXPECT DICK TO DO THAT RIGHT AT FIRST HE'S OFFICIAL FENCE MENDER JUST AT PRESENT DORA DEFENDED THE ABSENT BOY MISTER HARVEY
4788-91208-0010 INCAPABLE OF BEING PROVED FROM OTHER PROPOSITIONS IT FOLLOWED THAT IF THEY WERE KNOWN TO US AT ALL THEY MUST BE ORIGINAL DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE WAS A PERFECT PARADISE OF QUESTION BEGGING THE ULTIMATE MAJOR PREMISE IN EVERY ARGUMENT BEING ASSUMED
4788-91208-0030 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0032 AND WE JOIN WITH HIM IN CONTEMNING AS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL AND MEAN THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN NATURE AS INCAPABLE OF GIVING ITS LOVE AND DEVOTING ITS EXISTENCE TO ANY OBJECT WHICH CANNOT AFFORD IN EXCHANGE AN ETERNITY OF PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
4788-94904-0000 WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
4788-94904-0027 A REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY DRAWN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES WOULD SIMPLY REFLECT THEIR OWN TURBULENT INSUBORDINATION IT WOULD REFUSE ITS AUTHORITY TO ALL PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE ON THEIR SAVAGE INDEPENDENCE ANY IMPROVING RESTRAINT
4788-94904-0034 HE WAS THE OBJECT OF HOPE AND RELIANCE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WHILE EACH LOCAL POTENTATE WAS ONLY POWERFUL WITHIN A MORE OR LESS CONFINED SPACE AT HIS HANDS REFUGE AND PROTECTION WERE SOUGHT FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FIRST ONE
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
481-123719-0013 AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
481-123720-0000 ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
481-123720-0014 AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0060 ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
4813-248638-0018 THE VIEW FROM THE BACK HOLDS EVEN MORE INTIMATE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE OLD OLD GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THE EPHEMERAL BLOSSOMS OF THE PRESENT SPRINGTIME SHINE BRIGHTLY FORTH THE BOX FULL TWENTY FEET HIGH SPEAKS OF ANOTHER EPOCH
4813-248641-0027 FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FORTIFY THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE IN A NEW LAND IT WAS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH FURNISHED THIS MOTIVE POWER DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTS AND DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED FORCE ARE NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE DIAMOND FROM THE EARTH
4813-248641-0029 ARE SACRIFICED TO A CAUSE LONG SINCE WON THE PURITANS THEMSELVES GREW AWAY FROM MANY OF THEIR EXCESSIVE SEVERITIES BUT AS THEY GAINED BODILY STRENGTH FROM THEIR CONFLICT WITH THE ELEMENTS SO THEY GAINED A CERTAIN MORAL STAMINA
4813-248641-0053 WELL VERSED IN BIBLICAL LORE CHOSE FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ACCORD POND AND GLAD TIDINGS PLAIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM SOME PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WHILE THE NEAR BY SEA OF GALILEE AND JERUSALEM ROAD
4830-25898-0026 EATING EVERYTHING SHE COULD FIND AND OFTEN MAKING HERSELF ILL BY GOBBLING TOO FAST AND FORGETTING TO EAT A LITTLE GRAVEL TO HELP DIGEST HER FOOD DON'T GO OUT OF THE BARN CHILDREN I'M GOING TO LAY AN EGG
4830-25904-0025 AS A CONTRAST TO THE WILD BEASTS I WENT TO SEE THE MONKEYS WHO LIVED IN A FINE LARGE HOUSE ALL TO THEMSELVES HERE WAS EVERY VARIETY FROM THE GREAT UGLY CHIMPANZEE TO THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOWS
4853-27670-0001 I HAD NO SOONER SAT UP THAN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENT SITUATION INSTANTLY CAME TO ME MY HAIR WAS STIFF WITH ICE THERE WAS NO MORE FEELING IN MY HANDS THAN HAD THEY BEEN OF STONE
4853-27671-0024 SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
4853-29413-0016 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4859-26870-0008 SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT NICHOLAS WHEN DID YOU BREAK YOUR CAMEO SHE ASKED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT LOOKING AT HIS FINGER ON WHICH HE WORE A RING WITH A CAMEO OF LAOCOON'S HEAD TODAY IT WAS THE SAME AFFAIR OH MARY DON'T REMIND ME OF IT AND AGAIN HE FLUSHED
4898-28461-0027 BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
4898-28461-0047 WELL I HAVE WARNED YOU I SAID AND WILL NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY TROUBLE THAT MAY ARISE HE PROVED TO BE A STOUT WALKER AND WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS ACROSS A BRUSHY TIMBERED FLAT
5022-29405-0007 THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
5022-29405-0012 WAS IT A PLEASANT DINNER PARTY LAST NIGHT I ASKED AS IF THE SUBJECT REALLY INTERESTED ME I HAD NOT BEEN QUITE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS IN ENGLAND YET AND I WAS BECOMING A HUMBUG ALREADY
5022-29405-0036 HIS DAUGHTER INTERFERED AND STOPPED HIM AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY OFFERING HIS ARM TO CONDUCT ME IN STATE ACROSS THE KITCHEN CRISTEL HAD JUST PUT HER PRETTY BROWN HAND OVER HIS MOUTH AND SAID OH FATHER DO PRAY BE QUIET
5022-29411-0001 STILL WHILE CRISTEL'S ENTREATIES AND CRISTEL'S INFLUENCE HAD FAILED TO SHAKE ME GLOODY'S STRANGE LANGUAGE AND GLOODY'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT HAD TROUBLED MY MIND I FELT VAGUELY UNEASY IRRITATED BY MY OWN DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
5022-29411-0003 IT IS PERHAPS ONLY RIGHT TO ADD THAT MY PATIENCE HAD BEEN TRIED BY THE PROGRESS OF DOMESTIC EVENTS WHICH AFFECTED LADY LENA AND MYSELF VIEWED AS VICTIMS CALLING WITH MY STEPMOTHER AT LORD UPPERCLIFF'S HOUSE LATER IN THE DAY
5022-29411-0006 NEITHER OF THESE ANTICIPATIONS WAS REALIZED ONCE MORE MY CLEVER STEPMOTHER HAD PUZZLED ME MISSUS ROYLAKE TALKED AS FLUENTLY AS EVER EXHAUSTING ONE COMMON PLACE SUBJECT AFTER ANOTHER
5022-29411-0015 WHEN WE HAD LEFT EACH OTHER I THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY WHO WAS LADY RACHEL'S HUSBAND HE WAS A PERFECT STRANGER BUT I PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE AND FELT THAT I TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SEA
5022-29411-0033 OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
5022-29411-0035 PRAY BE KINDER TO ME THAN EVER PRAY LET ME BE I SAID I WOULD RETURN ON THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SORE HEART OLD TOLLER HIGHLY APPROVED OF MY CONDUCT HE RUBBED HIS FLESHLESS HANDS AND WHISPERED
5022-29411-0047 I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
5022-29411-0059 I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS KYLAM IT WAS SITUATED BEHIND A PROMONTORY OF THE RIVER BANK CLOTHED THICKLY WITH TREES AND WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE MILL IN THE PRESENT DIRECTION OF THE WIND WE COULD HEAR THE STRIKING OF THE CHURCH CLOCK
5049-25947-0007 BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
5049-25947-0037 KANE WAS SMILING WITH THE CHARMING CONTENT OF A PERFECTLY HAPPY MAN WHEN CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN TOLD HIM HIS MEN WERE NOT NEEDED AND TO REJOIN HIS TROOP HE LED HIS DETAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE HILL ON WHICH WE LAY
5049-25947-0046 HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
5049-25947-0078 I BORROWED A CARBINE FROM A WOUNDED MAN AND JOINED THE REMNANT OF L TROOP WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE TRAIL THIS TROOP WAS THEN COMMANDED BY SECOND LIEUTENANT DAY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT THAT MORNING
5049-25947-0097 SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
5049-25947-0108 THE ENTRANCE TO HIS WOUND WAS SO SMALL THAT CHURCH COULD NOT INSERT ENOUGH OF THE GAUZE PACKING TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HOLE LARGER HE SAID TO THE BOY OR YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH
5104-33407-0048 AFTER THAT HE SET OUT AND CAME TO GREENLAND IS NOT GUDRID BEAUTIFUL AND SHE IS WISE I MEAN TO MARRY HER IF HER FATHER WILL PERMIT IT
5163-39921-0033 AND BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER ESTHER WAS NOT TO BE TURNED FROM HER OBJECT THUS ALTHOUGH SHE FELT HER COURAGE EBBING AWAY FROM HER AS IT ALWAYS DID IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROPPER IMPERVIOUSNESS
5163-39921-0035 AS A RULE I DO NOT THINK ALFRED AND ROBERT HAVE BEEN TROUBLESOME TO THEIR TEACHERS WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING NOW THEY REFUSE TO OBEY MY ORDERS SAID ESTHER FAINTLY
5163-39921-0037 NOT THAT I DISAPPROVE OF YOU PERSONALLY FAR FROM IT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I HAVE HEARD MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ORDER IN SCHOOL AT PRESENT I HAD NO TROUBLE UNTIL YOUR BOYS CAME
5163-39921-0039 WHEN I SEND MY BOYS TO SCHOOL I NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE TEACHER WILL BE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK SHE HAS BEEN HIRED TO DO THEN YOU REFUSE TO HELP ME SAID ESTHER IN A TREMBLING VOICE

6367-65536-0031 THE CHILDLESS WIFELESS MAN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE HILL WONDERED IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY PERHAPS SO THERE HAD BEEN JOYCE
6367-65536-0069 IN THE QUIET PLACES AND THE GREEN WAYS SHE HAD FOUND WHAT HE HAD FAILED TO FIND THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS AND CONTENT HE KNEW THAT IF THIS WOMAN HAD WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH HIM THROUGH THE YEARS
6385-220959-0010 THIS IS AN INTELLECTUAL OR SPIRITUAL STATE TO EXPLAIN WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU SAY SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL MADE GREAT PROGRESS
6385-220959-0011 THOUGH HE IS REMAINING IN THE SAME PLACE OR AGAIN SUCH A ONE'S POSITION WAS EXALTED ALTHOUGH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HE WALKS UPON THE EARTH THIS EXALTATION AND THIS PROGRESS ARE SPIRITUAL STATES AND INTELLECTUAL REALITIES
6385-34655-0015 THE MAZE OF PASSAGES AND ALCOVES WITH SECRET AND BEWILDERING DOORS CHECKED AND RETARDED HIS PROGRESS HE STROVE TO RUN HE WAS OBLIGED TO WANDER HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BUT ONE DOOR TO THRUST OPEN WHILE HE HAD A SKEIN OF DOORS TO UNRAVEL
6385-34655-0026 THIS WAS A LABYRINTH AT EACH STEP HE WAS STOPPED BY SOME MAGNIFICENT OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO RETARD HIS EXIT AND TO BE UNWILLING TO LET HIM PASS HE WAS ENCOMPASSED BY A NET OF WONDERS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AND HELD BACK
6415-100596-0004 THE FRESHMEN ARE SIMPLY SCRAMBLING TO GET IN THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW FRAEULEIN SCHERIN HOW MUCH INTEREST THEY TAKE IN THE SUBJECT GEORGIE LAUGHED PATTY PICKED UP THE PENCIL WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN
6415-100596-0016 AND ADVISED ME TO STAY IN IT SO I SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL NOT PRESENT MY LETTER AT THE MEETING AFTER ALL AS I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER ADVICE KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0032 I'M AFRAID SO SIGHED PATTY IT'S BEEN VERY ENTERTAINING BUT SHE IS REALLY GETTING SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT AND I DON'T DARE MENTION KATE FERRIS'S NAME WHEN WE'RE ALONE
6415-111615-0007 REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY NEWSPAPER DESIRING A REALLY UNUSUAL EDITORIAL FEATURE ADDRESS HUMORIST ET CETERA SO BESOTTED WAS I I WOULD HAVE PAID TO HAVE THIS PRINTED IF I HAD NOT BEEN COUNSELLED BY AN OLDER AND WISER HEAD
6415-111615-0028 THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
6415-116629-0002 AND I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN FIVE FRANCS TO A FELLOW LIKE YOU WHAT IS IT SHOW IT TO ME
6415-116629-0029 BUT HE KNEW THE STRAIGHT ROAD AND WOULD NOT HIS STEPS TURN BACK TO IT AGAIN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN HER LITTLE DIETERLI LOVED GOOD AND ORDERLY CONDUCT IT COULD NOT BE THAT HE HAD LOST HIS LOVE FOR IT
6415-116629-0030 THAT IN THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF LIFE LIES INWARD AND OUTWARD BLESSING SHE RECALLED THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS BORNE FROM THE HOUSE TO HIS BURIAL SHE HAD TAKEN THE CHILDREN BY THE HAND AND STUPEFIED WITH PAIN WAS ABOUT TO PUT THEM TO BED
6437-66172-0003 THIS WAS AN HONOR TO WHICH I HAD LONG ASPIRED BUT BEING A NEW BOY I WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE FRATERNITY UNTIL MY CHARACTER HAD FULLY DEVELOPED ITSELF IT WAS A VERY SELECT SOCIETY THE OBJECT OF WHICH I NEVER FATHOMED
6437-66172-0024 BY THESE SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS MEASURES WE KEPT OUR TREASURY IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION SOMETIMES HAVING ON HAND AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER I HAVE SAID THAT THE SOCIETY HAD NO SPECIAL OBJECT IT IS TRUE THERE WAS A TACIT UNDERSTANDING AMONG US
6437-66173-0017 BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
6437-66173-0057 IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
6454-93938-0008 BUT THE NEXT STEP REVEALED THE OBJECT FOR THE LAWYER THEN ASKED FOR A SEARCH WARRANT TO LOOK FOR STOLEN PROPERTY THE JUDGE WAS EQUALLY OBLIGING AND BEGAN TO FILL ONE OUT ON THE INSTANT
6476-57446-0009 AT LAST GENZABURO LOOKING SAZEN IN THE FACE SAID THERE IS A SERVICE WHICH I WANT YOU TO RENDER ME A VERY SECRET SERVICE BUT AS IF YOU WERE TO REFUSE ME I SHOULD BE PUT TO SHAME BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT THAT SERVICE IS
6476-57446-0010 WELL THEN SAID GENZABURO GREATLY PLEASED AND DRAWING TEN RIYOS FROM HIS BOSOM THIS IS BUT A SMALL PRESENT TO MAKE TO YOU ON MY FIRST VISIT BUT PRAY ACCEPT IT NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES OF ME
6476-57446-0060 YOU SHALL HAVE THE HUNDRED RIYOS YOU ASK FOR BUT AS I HAVE NOT SO MUCH MONEY BY ME AT PRESENT I WILL GO TO GENZABURO'S HOUSE AND FETCH IT IT'S GETTING DARK NOW BUT IT'S NOT VERY LATE
6529-62554-0004 WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
6529-62554-0024 BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
6529-62554-0035 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
6529-62556-0008 HE UTTERED A MOAN SO FEEBLE THAT THEY ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS HIS LAST SIGH HERBERTS BACK WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM ANOTHER CONTUSED WOUND BY WHICH THE BALL HAD IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED GOD BE PRAISED SAID THE REPORTER THE BALL IS NOT IN THE BODY AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT IT
6529-62556-0029 HOWEVER HERBERT SCARCELY SUFFERED AT ALL AND THE COLD WATER WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONSTANTLY BATHED PREVENTED ANY INFLAMMATION OF THE WOUNDS THE SUPPURATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN A REGULAR WAY THE FEVER DID NOT INCREASE
6529-62556-0034 AT THE MOMENT HE SCALED THE PALISADE HAD CLEARLY SEEN SOME ONE OF THE CONVICTS RUNNING ALONG THE SOUTHERN SPUR OF MOUNT FRANKLIN TOWARDS WHOM TOP HAD SPRUNG IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE OBJECT HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY DEFEATED BY THE ROCKS AT THE MOUTH OF THE MERCY
6531-61334-0012 THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
6531-61334-0018 IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0039 HE ALSO EXTENDED AND REDECORATED THE ROYAL PALACE AT NINEVEH AND DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TEMPLES TRIBUTE POURED IN FROM THE SUBJECT STATES THE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY TRIBES IN THE NORTH FURNISHED IN ABUNDANCE WINE AND CORN
6531-61334-0078 THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0099 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON
6563-285357-0010 AND SHE WAS SPEEDILY REDUCED TO INDISTINGUISHABLE SCRAP DESPITE CATASTROPHE THE INVENTOR WRESTLED GAMELY WITH HIS PROJECT THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ONE DISASTER WERE TAKEN TO HEART
6563-285357-0025 HE COULD FORGE AHEAD UNTRAMMELLED BY ANXIETY AND WORRY ANOTHER ZEPPELIN WAS BUILT AND IT CREATED A WORLD'S RECORD IT REMAINED ALOFT FOR THIRTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT COVERED SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILES AND ALTHOUGH IT CAME TO GRIEF UPON ALIGHTING
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0031 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN WAS ACCEPTED AS A PERFECT MACHINE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISPERSE THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISASTER WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN ENVELOPED FROM THE FIRST VESSEL AFTER VESSEL HAS GONE UP IN SMOKE AND FLAME FEW CRAFT OF THIS TYPE
6563-63821-0009 IT COULD NOW BE MATCHED IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVED TO SEE THIS RARITY COMMAND IN NEW YORK THE PRICE OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HE WOULD SHOW YOU FORTY ONE WORKS IN THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS OF INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER
6563-63821-0016 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING EVERY YEAR FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ONWARD HE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOOKS PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO ARRANGED THAT A STUDENT COULD TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE ART OF PRINTING FROM THE DAYS OF CAXTON
6563-63821-0023 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM EVER WILL BE I WANT A MILLION OR SO MYSELF AH BOY THE OLD MAN REPLIED YOU WANT A MILLION BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT ENOUGH WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT IS PLEASURE AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH
6563-63821-0032 HE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUSCRIPT WAS LOST THE TASTE THEN FORMED GREW WITH HIS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HIS STRENGTH AT TEN HE LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER AND WENT INTO A PRINTING OFFICE
669-129061-0010 OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
669-129061-0027 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HURRIEDLY THE PERSONAL CONFLICT WITH LORD STEYNE TO AN AFFAIR OF THAT NATURE OF COURSE HE SAID THERE WAS BUT ONE ISSUE
669-129074-0015 AND INDEED BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE DOBBIN SUBJECT A SCORE OF TIMES EVERY DAY MEANS WERE EASILY FOUND TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF GEORGY AND THE SERVANTS AMELIA'S MAID
6818-68772-0004 AFTER LUNCHEON BEGAN THE SPEECH MAKING INTERSPERSED WITH MUSIC BY THE BAND LOUISE MADE THE PRELIMINARY ADDRESS AND ALTHOUGH HER VOICE WAS NOT VERY STRONG
6818-68772-0010 SO WE GAVE THEM AN OBJECT LESSON WE PAINTED OUT ALL THE SIGNS IN THIS SECTION AT OUR OWN EXPENSE THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL YOUR HOMES ARE WITHOUT THEM
6818-68772-0042 DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A
6818-68772-0044 BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MISTER FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
6818-76332-0031 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
6818-76332-0037 I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
6836-61804-0031 BOTH STILL THIS SIDE OF MIDDLE LIFE RESIDING UNDER THEIR ROOF YOU WOULD FIND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF ARISTOCRATIC AIR AND VENERABLE ASPECT WITHAL CHATTY AND CHEERFUL WHO WOULD CONDUCT YOU AROUND THE CORRALES
6848-252323-0000 THERE'S EIGHT OR NINE OF US HERE WOULD MISS HIM IF HE WAS GONE TROTH HE DOESN'T GIVE MUCH EMPLOYMENT BUT WE COULDN'T SPARE HIM CROAKED OUT A THIRD WHEN THE ENTRANCE OF THE CORPORAL CUT SHORT FURTHER COMMENTARY AND THE PARTY GATHERED AROUND THE CHEERFUL TURF FIRE
6848-252323-0013 BILLY AT THE SAME MOMENT TOOK OUT HIS FIDDLE AND BEGAN THAT PROCESS OF PREPARATORY SCREWING AND SCRAPING WHICH NO MATTER HOW DISTRESSING TO THE SURROUNDERS SEEMS TO AFFORD INTENSE DELIGHT TO PERFORMERS ON THIS INSTRUMENT IN THE PRESENT CASE
6848-76049-0030 I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING OF OUR OLD RIVER SEVERN WE WILL COME RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT IF WE GO THROUGH BRISTOL THERE WE SHALL HAVE A WHIFF OF AMERICA OUR NEW FIND FROM WHICH THE TOBACCO COMES
6880-216547-0002 YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR
6880-216547-0005 MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES THIS IDEA FOREIGN AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED TO THE OBJECT OF MY CANDIDACY YOU RECEIVED FAVORABLY
6880-216547-0011 MY PERCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT THESE SCIENCES THOUGH BADLY DEFINED AS TO THEIR OBJECT AND NOT CONFINED TO THEIR SPHERE ARE LIKE THE NATURAL SCIENCES SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION AND CERTAINTY
6880-216547-0028 THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0033 WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY WHAT IS PROPERTY SUCH GENTLEMEN IS THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR THAT I OFFER YOU TO DAY
6880-216547-0034 IF I HAVE RIGHTLY GRASPED THE OBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHT IF I SUCCEED IN BRINGING TO LIGHT A TRUTH WHICH IS INDISPUTABLE BUT FROM CAUSES WHICH I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE EXPLAINED
6880-216547-0051 OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0059 TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER THE ACADEMY IN ITS DEBATE OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH REPLIED TO THE ADDRESS OF ITS PENSIONER BY A NOTE THE TEXT OF WHICH I GIVE BELOW
6880-216547-0079 THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0081 DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
6880-216547-0107 FOR THE REST I ALLOW THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION THE MIND MAY LEGITIMATELY HESITATE BEFORE DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY
6925-80680-0074 SO HE SENT FORTH HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES PROCLAIMING THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY ANY PERSON FITTED FOR A BRIDEGROOM AND HEIR TO THE THRONE SHOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE PALACE WHEN THE DAY CAME ALL THE COURT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
696-92939-0006 THE SHOREDITCH INFIRMARY IN HOXTON AND THE SAINT PANCRAS INFIRMARY AND SHE GAINED A REPUTATION BOTH FOR HARD WORK AND EFFICIENCY WHILE HER PATIENTS OFTEN SPOKE OF HER GENTLENESS AND HER KINDNESS NOT CONTENT WITH FORGETTING A PATIENT WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL
696-92939-0028 AND THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN INFLICTED FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED HE ALSO WROTE A NOTE TO THE BARON WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR BARON I AM TOO ILL TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO YOU IN PERSON
7059-77897-0003 I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE
7059-77897-0020 AND THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO DENY IT AS MISTER PUTNEY SAYS HE AND I HAVE OUR RECORD AND WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY PRETENCES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER I OUGHT TO GO BACK ON MY FELLOW HANDS OH
7059-88364-0000 AROUND LOS ANGELES THE GREATEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC MOVING PICTURE COLONIES ARE BEING BUILT EACH PHOTOPLAY MAGAZINE HAS ITS CALIFORNIA LETTER TELLING OF THE PUTTING UP OF NEW STUDIOS AND THE TRANSFER OF ACTORS
7059-88364-0012 YET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE PRESENT DAY MAN IN THE STREET MAN ABOUT TOWN CALIFORNIAN HAS AN OBVIOUS MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIM THAT IS ALLIED TO THE EUCALYPTUS TREE THE POMEGRANATE CALIFORNIA IS A GILDED STATE
7067-76047-0004 FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A WILD HOPE THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD AGREE AND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE MEANT ONLY THE PREPARATION OF AN ULTIMATUM I OBJECT TO MISS GRAMMONT AND THAT SIDE OF THE THING MORE THAN I DO TO MISS SEYFFERT
7067-76047-0015 BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
7067-76047-0016 AND HONOUR THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MATTERS OF PROPERTY ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC CONDUCT IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST THE REVERSE THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND MUCH MORE INSISTENCE LEGAL INSISTENCE UPON INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
7067-76047-0048 AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
7067-76048-0055 FOR A NUMBER OF TRIVIAL REASONS SIR RICHMOND FOUND HIMSELF ASCRIBING THE PROJECT OF THIS NEW AGE ALMOST WHOLLY TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND PRESENTING IT AS A MUCH COMPLETER SCHEME THAN HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT WAS TRUE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD NOT SAID MANY OF THE THINGS SIR RICHMOND ASCRIBED TO HIM
7067-76048-0056 BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
7078-271888-0024 AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0044 SHE IMPLORED TEARFULLY AT LEAST I AM HONEST MY OBJECT IN COMING THIS AFTERNOON WAS TO REPAY THE MONEY I I BORROWED
7078-271888-0050 PROMISE TO KEEP MY SECRET FOR THE PRESENT I WILL PRESERVE SILENCE I ANSWERED MY HEART SOFTENING TOWARDS HER BUT I CANNOT PROMISE THAT I WILL NEVER TELL HIM
7078-271888-0058 ETHEL WILL NOT SIT FOR ANY OTHER SUBJECT IT HARDLY DOES HER JUSTICE DOES IT IT IS A STRANGE FANCY OF MINE SHE EXPLAINED WHEN I HAD GREETED HER I'M SURE THE DRESS IS VERY BECOMING ISN'T IT
7078-271888-0059 AND SHE WAVED THE GOBLET SHE WAS HOLDING ABOVE HER HEAD YOUR POSE IS PERFECT DEAR PLEASE DON'T ALTER IT URGED THE ARTIST WHO ADVANCING TO HIS EASEL AGAIN CONTINUED THE FREE RAPID OUTLINE
7078-271888-0095 THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
7113-86041-0025 BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
7113-86041-0026 RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN HIGH GLEE AND CALLING MERRILY TO EACH OTHER AT LAST WHEN THEY WERE QUITE WEARY THE PRINCESS CRIED OUT SUDDENLY THAT NOTHING WOULD CONTENT HER BUT TO BATHE IN THE MARBLE POOL
7113-86041-0040 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
7148-59157-0023 AS WELL AS ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO TRANSMUTE IT INTO PERFECT LITERATURE HE SEEMS TO HAVE ADMIRED WOMEN VULGARLY AS CREATURES WHOSE HANDS WERE WAITING TO BE SQUEEZED RATHER THAN AS EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS
7148-59157-0039 HAD HE LIVED LONGER HE MIGHT HAVE INVADED OTHER WORLDS HIS RECASTING OF HYPERION OPENS WITH A CRY OF DISTRUST IN THE ARTIST WHO IS CONTENT TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF HIS ART
7148-7763-0001 IT WAS OF NO COMMON IMPORTANCE TO ME AT THIS PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST AND MATURE MY THOUGHTS FOR MY OWN MIND ONLY WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE CALL FOR GIVING THEM OUT IN PRINT HAD I GONE ON WRITING
7148-7763-0005 THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-82991-0007 RULED THE LAND AND WHEN HIS ELDER SON PRINCE ARTHUR WAS ALIVE LIKEWISE IN THAT YEAR THE YOUNG PRINCE ESPOUSED CATHERINE OF ARRAGON OUR PRESENT QUEEN AND SOON AFTERWARDS DIED WHEREUPON THE OLD KING
7148-82991-0026 HEED NOT WHAT THE VILLAIN SAYS MY GOOD FELLOW SAID THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH YOU HAVE CAPTURED HIM BRAVELY AND I WILL TAKE CARE YOUR CONDUCT IS DULY REPORTED TO HIS MAJESTY TO THE CASTLE WITH HIM TO THE CASTLE
7148-82991-0031 TRAVERSED THE SPACE BEFORE THE WEST END OF SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL AND DESCENDING A SHORT FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AT THE LEFT AND THREADING A NARROW PASSAGE PRESENTLY ARRIVED AT THE ARCHED ENTRANCE IN THE CURFEW
7178-34644-0006 AND IN HIS MOST SOLEMN TONE READ AS FOLLOWS IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST THIS PRESENT DAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JANUARY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETIETH YEAR OF OUR LORD
7178-34644-0016 BEING THEN BARELY TWO YEARS OLD HARDQUANONNE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM THE OPERATION BUCCA FISSA AND THE SAID CHILD IS THE ONLY LIVING SUBJECT UPON WHICH IT HAS BEEN ESSAYED
7178-34644-0018 AT THE TIME THAT I AM WRITING THIS HARDQUANONNE WHO HAS PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE FACTS AND PARTICIPATED AS PRINCIPAL THEREIN IS DETAINED IN THE PRISONS OF HIS HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
7178-34644-0050 FOR A SOB THE LAUGHED CEASED AND THE MAN LAY BACK HIS EYELIDS CLOSED THE SHERIFF WHO HAD ALLOWED THE PRISONER TO SPEAK RESUMED ALL WHICH IS PLACED ON RECORD
7178-34644-0061 AND LOOKING GWYNPLAINE IN THE FACE SAID TO YOU HERE PRESENT WE PHILIP DENZILL PARSONS KNIGHT SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY OF SURREY
7178-34645-0026 WHOM THE QUEEN BELIEVED IN BECAUSE HE WAS SHORT SIGHTED LIKE HERSELF OR EVEN MORE SO HAD COMMITTED TO WRITING A MEMORANDUM COMMENCING THUS TWO BIRDS WERE SUBJECT TO SOLOMON A LAPWING THE HUDBUD
7190-90542-0016 ON THIS OCCASION I WENT TO QUARLES WITH THE OBJECT OF INTERESTING HIM IN THE WITHAN CASE AND HE FORESTALLED ME BY BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT IT THE MOMENT I ENTERED THE ROOM HERE I MAY MENTION A FACT WHICH I HAD NOT DISCOVERED AT FIRST
7190-90542-0030 I TOOK THE TROUBLE TO MAKE INQUIRY WHETHER ANY SIMILAR CRIME HAD HAPPENED IN ENGLAND IN THE JANUARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR AND HAD THE SAME INQUIRY MADE IN FRANCE THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ANY MURDER BEARING THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE WITHAN TRAGEDY
7190-90543-0046 IF THE THIEF HAD NOT FOUND WHAT HE WANTED HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS SEARCH I ARGUED FOR SOME REASON HE CONNECTED SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD WITH THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH
7226-86964-0007 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0010 ONLY THE GABLES OF A FEW HOUSES CAN BE SEEN FROM THE RIVER WHOSE BANKS OF YELLOW CLAY AND BROWN MUD ARE HERE TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH DURING THE FIRST THIRD OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THIS PLACE WAS THE SITE OF A WINNEBAGO VILLAGE WHOSE CHIEF
7226-86964-0031 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7264-92310-0004 AN INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER OWNER MIGHT FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DISLIKE FOR THE TRADE IN PATENT MEDICINES HE MIGHT OBJECT TO THE SWINDLING OF THE POOR WHICH IS THE SOUL OF THAT TRADE HE MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE SUFFERED ACUTE PHYSICAL PAIN
7264-92310-0013 HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
7264-92314-0018 THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
7264-92314-0029 IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND AND FOR ALL I KNOW ELSEWHERE THERE HAS ARISEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPLETE CORRUPTION AND FALSEHOOD OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CROP OF NEW ORGANS WHICH ARE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD ORGANS OF OPINION
7264-92314-0031 SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
7264-92316-0012 FELT NO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE DEBATS FOR INSTANCE HIS PARTICULAR CATHOLIC ENTHUSIASM RECOGNIZED ITSELF AS EXCEPTIONAL AND WAS CONTENT TO ACCEPT THE HUMBLE OR AT ANY RATE INFERIOR POSITION WHICH ADMITTED ECCENTRICITY CONNOTES LATER
7264-92316-0013 THESE FOUNDERS OF THE FREE PRESS SEEMED TO SAY WE MAY CONVERT THE MASS TO OUR VIEWS BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE ADMITTEDLY A CLIQUE AN EXCEPTIONAL BODY WITH THE PENALTIES ATTACHING TO SUCH
7264-92316-0024 WE MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT PROPAGANDA WAS IN ORDER OF TIME THE FIRST MOTIVE OF THE FREE PRESS AND THE FIRST CAUSE OF ITS PRODUCTION NOW FROM THIS FACT ARISES A CONSIDERATION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR SUBJECT
7264-92316-0031 THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7278-104730-0001 WAS TO PRESENT FIFTEEN PETITIONS SIGNED NUMEROUSLY BY CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA PRAYING FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE SIMPLY MOVED THEIR REFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
7278-104730-0018 THAT WHEREAS THE AGITATION OF THE SUBJECT WAS DISQUIETING AND OBJECTIONABLE ALL PETITIONS
7278-104730-0025 INCIPIENT STAGE OF SUCH A CONFLICT THAT TESTS THE METTLE OF THE LITTLE BAND OF INNOVATORS WHEN IT GROWS INTO A GREAT PARTY QUESTION MUCH LESS COURAGE IS DEMANDED THE MERE PRESENTATION OF AN
7278-104730-0026 AS THEN MADE UP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WORE HARDLY EVEN UPON THE IRON TEMPER AND INFLEXIBLE DISPOSITION OF MISTER ADAMS THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT ERROR OF CONDUCT IN ME AT THIS TIME HE WRITES IN APRIL
7278-246956-0008 THAN ALL THE REST LEOPOLD WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIM AND WHILE HE STROVE TO AVOID ABSORPTION IN A PERSONAL INTEREST HOWEVER JUSTIFIABLE IT WAS OF NECESSITY
7278-246956-0030 APOSTOLIC CAREFULNESS HAVE PROTECTED HIM I SUSPECT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MORE VULGAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS STILL TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHO LOVES NOT IS BUT TO GIVE HIM THE MORE
7278-246956-0035 I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER AUNT HAS THE GOOD SENSE NEVER TO INTERRUPT US THERE HE ADDED I'LL JUST RUN AND SHOW MYSELF TO LEOPOLD HE MUST NOT SUSPECT THAT I AM OF YOUR PARTY AND
7278-91083-0012 HAS A LITTLE PLANETARIUM ATTACHED AND NEARLY SIX THOUSAND TEETH IN WHEELS IT WAS MADE FOR JOSEPH POTTS WHO PAID SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE SPANISH MINISTER IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT OFFERED EIGHT HUNDRED FOR IT THAT HE MIGHT PRESENT IT TO HIS SOVEREIGN
730-358-0011 THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
730-358-0061 THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
730-360-0016 WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
730-360-0028 AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH
730-360-0031 AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
7302-86814-0008 SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR
7302-86814-0011 HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG BUG SAID ANOTHER DRESSES IN FINE STYLE AND THEN TO BE HERE SO YOUNG OH WHAT LARKS MEANWHILE THE OBJECT OF THIS HIDEOUS ADMIRATION APPROACHED THE WICKET
7302-86815-0038 MY MISTRESS WISHES MUCH TO BE PRESENT AT THE TRIAL AH SAID VILLEFORT WITH A STARTLING ACCENT DOES SHE WISH THAT THE MAN DREW BACK AND SAID
7302-86815-0061 YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THESE DIFFERENT CRIMES WITH IMPUDENT ADDRESS BUT WHICH COULD ONLY DECEIVE THOSE WHOSE AFFECTIONS FOR YOU BLINDED THEM
7312-92432-0020 SHE INFORMED ME THAT SHE HAD SENT FOR ME TO PLACE IN MY HAND A PACKET OF IMPORTANT PAPERS WHICH SHE WISHED ME TO KEEP FOR THE PRESENT AND IN THE EVENT OF HER DEATH TO TRANSMIT IT TO HER FRIENDS IN THE UNITED STATES SHE THEN STATED THAT SHE WAS MARRIED TO MARQUIS OSSOLI
7367-86737-0003 WHICH WILL MAKE IT STILL MORE DIFFICULT MY FRIEND SAID MORCERF LET US ENJOY THE PRESENT WITHOUT GLOOMY FOREBODINGS FOR THE FUTURE AT LEAST WE CAN HAVE A WINDOW WHERE IN THE CORSO AH A WINDOW EXCLAIMED SIGNOR PASTRINI
7367-86737-0037 LUIGI VAMPA COMES TO TAKE US AND WE TAKE HIM WE BRING HIM BACK TO ROME AND PRESENT HIM TO HIS HOLINESS THE POPE WHO ASKS HOW HE CAN REPAY SO GREAT A SERVICE THEN WE MERELY ASK FOR A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES AND WE SEE THE CARNIVAL IN THE CARRIAGE
7367-86737-0046 RECOLLECTED ME AND SET ME FREE NOT ONLY WITHOUT RANSOM BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF A VERY SPLENDID WATCH AND RELATED HIS HISTORY TO ME LET US SEE THE WATCH SAID ALBERT
7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0099 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7402-59171-0003 NOT THAT HE HAS NOT HAD HIS DISCIPLES MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WHAT MISTER SHAW SAYS ON ANY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE TIMES OR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN SAYS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED A CHURCH HOWEVER
7402-59171-0020 WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF HUMANITY REPEATING MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE NATURE OF THE CREED OF ARTISTS THERE IS A SIMILAR FALSIFICATION IN THE SAME PLAY IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN WHO IS PRESENT AT DUBEDAT'S DEATH
7402-59171-0029 MOLIERE DEPICTS THE MISER THE JEALOUS MAN THE MISANTHROPE THE HYPOCRITE WHEREAS SHAW DEPICTS THE BOURGEOIS THE REBEL THE CAPITALIST THE WORKMAN THE SOCIALIST THE DOCTOR
7402-90848-0043 BOBO WITH GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART TOOK ALONG THIS EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING ITS ANGRY POSSESSOR FARTHER ON THE LAD ENCOUNTERED TILDA'S FATHER THE UNHAPPY KING AND DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7402-90848-0047 AND THE BREASTPLATES OF THE ARMED MEN SHINING IN THE SUN AFTER A WEEK OF ALMOST CONSTANT PROGRESS FOR THE KING WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER THAT HE WOULD HARDLY GIVE THE CAVALCADE TIME TO REST
7447-91186-0009 CONSIDER A MOMENT WHETHER THIS WOULD BECOME YOU IF YOUR FRIENDS WISH YOU TO PLAY IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM PLEASURE TELL THEM YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO MAKE YOURSELF RIDICULOUS IN THEIR EYES AND BE CONTENT WITH YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR DOMESTIC OCCUPATIONS
7447-91186-0033 AMATEUR OR PROFESSOR WHOEVER THOU ART SEEK NOT IN THESE COMPOSITIONS FOR ANY PROFOUND FEELING THEY ARE ONLY A FROLIC OF ART MEANT TO INCREASE THY CONFIDENCE IN THE CLAVIER
7447-91186-0035 IT HAS BEEN APTLY SAID OF THIS MASTER OF MASTERS THAT HE CONSTRUCTED A GREAT UNIVERSITY OF MUSIC FROM WHICH ALL MUST GRADUATE WHO WOULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OF VALUE IN MUSIC MEN OF GENIUS FROM MOZART TO THE PRESENT TIME
7447-91186-0042 EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7505-258958-0005 ONLY WHEN GOODS ARE PRODUCED INDIVIDUALS MAY ACQUIRE INCOME BY GIFT BEQUEST THEFT OR OTHER MODES OF TRANSFER FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN MANY CASES THE TWO KINDS OF INCOME HOWEVER AGREE
7505-258958-0011 WHILE THEY GATHER FLOWERS WITH ONE HAND THEY DESTROY FUEL WITH THE OTHER ONLY THE NET INCREASE IN VALUE CAN BE ACCOUNTED INCOME IN THE SECOND PERIOD
7505-258958-0018 BETWEEN PRESENT AND FUTURE INCOMES THE VALUE OF THE MASS OF WEALTH IN POSSESSION AND YIELDING INCOME RESTS IN LARGE PART UPON ITS POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO INCOME IN SOME FUTURE PERIOD THUS
7505-258958-0029 BUT WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICE HAS FOR A MOMENT EMBODIED ITSELF IN MATERIAL FORM IS OF NO ESSENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPORT
7505-258958-0033 IF HE HAD NO MORE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION THAN IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE GOODS HERE ONLY PRESENT GOODS COULD HAVE VALUE TO HIM EVEN THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MUCH MORE THE SAVAGES
7505-258958-0035 OF THE PRESENT MOMENT IS COMPARED WITH A GRATIFICATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AT A FUTURE TIME THE PROBLEM INVOLVED IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN TIME IN PLACE AND IN THE NATURE OF THE WANT GRATIFIERS
7505-258964-0000 HE MULTIPLIES MANY OTHERS WE HAVE NOTED MANY KINDS OF DEPRECIATION DESTRUCTION AND WEARING OUT OF WEALTH BUT THE NORMAL THING IN A HEALTHY SOCIETY IS AN INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF RENT BEARERS
7505-258964-0001 THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
7505-258964-0002 AFFECTING THE UTILITY OF THE PRODUCTS THE FIRST OF THESE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THIS SECTION THE INCREASE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AGENTS IS USUALLY THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER
7505-258964-0003 AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
7505-258964-0004 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0019 BUT IN DOING THAT HE AFFECTS THE AGENTS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS THE IDEAL FROM A SOCIAL STANDPOINT IS TO INCREASE NOT RENT BUT THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY
7505-258964-0021 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0030 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0047 DUE TO ACCIDENTAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES RAISING THE RENTS OF WEALTH THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT MAY BE DEFINED AS AN INCREASE IN RENTS OR VALUE OF AGENTS
7511-102419-0034 WHICH WAS ME NAME BEFORE I WAS MARRIED TO ME MAN GOD REST HIS SOUL DEAR ELIZABETH SHE WAS GLAD TO GET AWAY I SUSPECT SHE AND HER WALLACE MADE A FINE COUPLE AS THEY RODE AWAY IN THE GOLDEN SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON
7517-100429-0009 HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
7517-100429-0010 SOOTHES US WHERE THE RECORD OF THE ORDINARY PEDANTIC RAIN GAUGE WOULD LEAVE US INFURIATED IT SPEAKS MUCH FOR MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S BREADTH OF VIEW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THIS
7517-100429-0018 MUST BE A RECORD BUT ANYHOW IT IS FAIRLY FINE NOW AND WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE LAWN TENNIS OR GOLF OR CROQUET OR AND SO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORNING ARE MADE
7517-100429-0022 WILL BE DECLINED SAY COME AND LOOK AT THE POND AND THE WORST SLUGGARD WILL NOT REFUSE SUCH GENTLE EXERCISE AND ONCE HE IS OUT HE IS OUT
7517-100437-0014 I SHALL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH YOUR GRATITUDE WELL THE WRITER OF MY BOOK IS KENNETH GRAHAME YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM GOOD I THOUGHT SO THE BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
7635-105409-0054 AND BY ALL THE OTHER PATRIARCHS I KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE STILL IN HADES I BELIEVE ACCORDING TO YOUR CREED AND CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH IN YOUR PRESENT TROUBLE NOW YOU DID NOT FULFIL YOUR SHARE OF THE BARGAIN BUT I AM READY TO FULFIL MINE HERE HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0057 THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0013 ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7780-274562-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0081 FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
7780-274562-0094 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0103 IN THE FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR WHICH RESULTED FROM PERSONAL DIRECTION OF HIS PLANS IN THE CONTINUOUS AND UNCEASING OBJECT WHICH THESE PLANS AFFORD
7794-295947-0018 WE MUST MAKE A PRESENT TO THE MESSENGER INDEED SIR I'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR MY TROUBLE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU MUST STOP THE NIGHT HERE THANK YOU SIR I'VE A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE
7794-295947-0039 WHOSE PENNILESS CONDITION FORMS A GREAT CONTRAST TO THE WEALTH OF THEIR INFERIORS IN RANK THE DAIMIOS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH RANK CAN BE BOUGHT OR SOLD IN JAPAN
7794-295947-0043 AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
78-368-0004 AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
78-368-0051 MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0010 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
7800-283492-0021 FRANK WAS ALWAYS ACCOMMODATING ESPECIALLY WHEN ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WAS CONCERNED HE LOVED TO WATCH THE SMALL WOODS FOLK WHEN THEY DID NOT SUSPECT HIS PRESENCE AND LEARN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INTERESTING HABITS
7859-102518-0032 HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HIS DISCONTENTED AND DEMORALIZED TROOPS HAD PROCLAIMED A REBEL EMPEROR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEM
7859-102519-0015 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0041 THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
8014-112586-0002 THIS LITTLE BOOK HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED WITH THE MAIN OBJECT OF SPREADING AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE AMONG OUR PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIVILISATION AND GENERAL SOCIAL CONDITION OF IRELAND FROM THE FIFTH OR SIXTH
8014-112602-0023 IN THIS RESPECT THEY RESEMBLED MANY OTHER NATIONS OF ANTIQUITY AS WELL INDEED AS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THEY ILLUSTRATED RUSKIN'S SAYING
8014-112602-0031 WHICH COVERED THEM DOWN TO THE ANKLES AND WHICH THEY WORE WINTER AND SUMMER WOMEN COMMONLY WORE A LONG LOOSE CLOAK WITH A HOOD A FASHION WHICH IS COMMON AT THE PRESENT DAY THE OVER GARMENTS WERE FASTENED BY BROOCHES PINS BUTTONS
8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8051-119902-0015 THE NAME IS REALLY A PRESENT TO THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION HAVING BEEN USED BY TWO LARGE FIRMS WHO GAVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR TRADE MARK
8051-119902-0030 RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
8063-274112-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE NOISE PRODUCED BY PLANCHET'S FALL D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE HEARD MANY OTHER AND VERY DIFFERENT FALLS DID NOT APPEAR TO PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT ONE BESIDES
8063-274116-0002 BETWEEN THE TWO A SMALL DOOR WITH A PORCH SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF PILLARS FORMED THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE THE DOOR WAS GAINED BY A STEP RAISED A LITTLE FROM THE GROUND
8063-274116-0015 AND HER EYES HALF CLOSED PURRING IN THAT SIGNIFICANT MANNER WHICH ACCORDING TO FELINE HABITS INDICATES PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8063-274117-0029 EITHER BY WAY OF ATTACK OR DEFENSE THAT THEY MUST BE CONVERSING ABOUT ANY OTHER SUBJECT THAN OF LOVE AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION THE LADY ROSE AND BOWED PROFOUNDLY TO ARAMIS
8088-284756-0011 I MADE THE FOUR MILES IN JUST A SHADE OVER THAT MANY MINUTES AND CLAMPED ON THE BRAKES AS I SAW THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE DRIVE THAT LED TOWARD THE SEA AND MERCER'S ESTATE
8088-284756-0020 HIS EYES DARK AND LARGE SMILED EASILY AND SHONE WITH INTEREST BUT HIS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL MOUTH BENEATH THE LONG SLIM MUSTACHE ALWAYS CLOSELY CROPPED SELDOM SMILED WITH HIS EYES BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENT EXCITED SPEECH THAT AMAZED ME MOST
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8095-274345-0006 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0012 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0034 THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274346-0011 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0044 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-278252-0003 AND WHEN I RODE OUT ON TO THE STAGE THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER AND CHEERS I MADE A SHORT ADDRESS AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WOULD SELL PHOTOS OF MAC A'RONY AND HIS MASTER AT THE DOOR
8098-278252-0021 AND HEARD HIM DELIVER HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS FROM THE REAR PLATFORM OF HIS PRIVATE CAR I SPENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN MASSILLON AND NEXT MORNING RETURNED TO CANTON TO TAKE SOME INTERIOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF MC KINLEY'S HOME
8098-278252-0026 A STORE LOOMED INTO VIEW SHORTLY I WAS ELATED ACCORDING TO THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE THE YOUNGER GENERATION WAS THE RULING POWER IT READ HEZEKIAH BRIMLEY AND FATHER
8098-278252-0038 THAT MIXTURE MIGHT SUIT MY STOMACH I THOUGHT BUT IT DOESN'T DELIGHT MY PALATE I FELT I HAD EATEN A HEAVY MEAL UNWITTINGLY AND SAT DOWN TO DIGEST IT I HADN'T SAT LONG BEFORE I FELT MYSELF SWELLING
8108-274318-0042 SMOKE WAS ADVANCING ACROSS THE CARPET HE SEEMED VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF AND SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUPREME INNOCENCE HE WAS NO SHADOW CAT BUT REAL AND FULL OF HIS USUAL AND PERFECT SELF POSSESSION HE MARCHED ALONG PICKING HIS WAY DELICATELY
8123-275193-0018 MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275216-0013 BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8226-274369-0003 THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
8226-274369-0028 BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
8226-274369-0035 THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
8226-274369-0048 WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
8226-274371-0016 WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0042 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8238-274553-0005 BUT LETTING THIS MATTER PASS FOR THE PRESENT I WILL MERELY OBSERVE THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF HIS SETTING FOOT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSITY HE BEGAN TO EXERCISE OVER THE HABITS
8238-274553-0043 IS AN OBSERVATION SO DIRECTLY OFFENSIVE AS TO ALLOW ME BUT ONE LINE OF CONDUCT
8238-274553-0045 THIS BEING DONE THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER I SHALL DISCHARGE THIS DECANTER OF WINE AT YOUR IMAGE IN YONDER MIRROR AND THUS FULFIL ALL THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE EXACT LETTER OF RESENTMENT FOR YOUR INSULT
8238-274553-0050 AFTER A TIRESOME HARANGUE IN HIS ORDINARY STYLE HE TOOK DOWN FROM HIS BOOK SHELVES A NUMBER OF MUSTY VOLUMES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DUELLO AND ENTERTAINED ME FOR A LONG TIME
8238-283452-0009 AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
83-11691-0039 WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
83-11691-0043 UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
83-11691-0044 THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
83-9960-0018 FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
831-130739-0043 HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
831-130746-0000 THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
8312-279790-0017 A FINGER'S LENGTH AND THE CHAIN WAS OF PEARLS EACH WEIGHING A POUND WHEN THE YOUNG KING RECEIVED THIS VERY HANDSOME PRESENT HE WAS MUCH PERPLEXED
839-130898-0026 CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
839-130898-0033 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
839-130898-0041 THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
839-130898-0043 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0057 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0075 HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY
8425-246962-0005 FOR GEORGE'S MANIPULATION OF THE MAGISTRATE COULD BUT DELAY THE DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH EVEN SHOULD NO DISCOVERY BE MADE LEOPOLD MUST AT LENGTH SUSPECT A TRICK AND THAT WOULD AT ONCE DRIVE HIM TO FRESH ACTION
8425-246962-0028 NOTHING COULD SATISFY HIM OF THAT LESS THAN THE CONSCIOUS PRESENCE OF THE PERFECT CHARITY WITHOUT THAT HE WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM WANDERING IN A DREAM AROUND ITS WALLS
8425-246962-0029 AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
8425-291444-0001 WHO SERVE AS THE TOTTERING MONUMENTS OF GOOD OLD TIMES WILL BE GATHERED TO THEIR FATHERS THEIR CHILDREN ENGROSSED BY THE EMPTY PLEASURES OR INSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRESENT AGE WILL NEGLECT TO TREASURE UP THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST
8425-291444-0006 BY THAT ADMIRABLE AND PRAISEWORTHY INSTITUTION THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY TO WHICH I HERE PUBLICLY RETURN MY SINCERE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN THE CONDUCT OF THIS INESTIMABLE WORK I HAVE ADOPTED NO INDIVIDUAL MODEL
8465-246942-0017 SUDDENLY HOWEVER IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE CURATE HAD HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND HAD THEREFORE BEEN COMPELLED TO TALK AT RANDOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD SUSPECT THE CRIME OF WHICH HER BROTHER HAD BEEN GUILTY
8465-246947-0006 BUT WHEN A MAN IS ONCE OVERWHELMED IN HIS OWN DEEDS WHEN THEY HAVE TURNED INTO SPECTRES TO MOCK AT HIM WHEN HE LOATHES HIMSELF AND TURNS WITH SICKNESS FROM PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE I KNOW BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT
8468-294887-0003 AMONG WHICH WERE THE ANTI SLAVERY RECORD THE EMANCIPATOR THE SLAVE'S FRIEND THE LATTER TO INDOCTRINATE THE CHILDREN IN ANTI SLAVERY THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ORIGINALLY BEGUN FOR THE SUPPORT OF A MISSION IN AFRICA
8468-294887-0006 AS WE ALMOST ALWAYS HAD SOME OF THE TRAVELERS TOWARD THE NORTH STAR PRESENT WHOSE MASTERS OR THEIR AGENTS WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE CITY IN HOT PURSUIT AT FIRST WE SENT THEM TO CANADA BUT AFTER A WHILE SENT THEM ONLY TO SYRACUSE AND THE CENTRE OF THE STATE
8468-294887-0024 WHOM THEY HAD HIRED TO CONDUCT THEM WITHOUT THE LIMITS OF THE CITY IN THE EVENING WHEN THE POLICE FORCE WAS CHANGED THEY CAME THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY TO MY OFFICE
8468-295198-0006 YOU ARE SUBJECT TO HEADACHES AND EVERY PHYSICIAN WILL TELL YOU THAT A TILTING MOTION DISORDERS THE STOMACH AND ACTS UPON THE BRAIN ASK OLD DOCTOR KITE I WAS TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT YOUR CASE ONLY YESTERDAY AND SAYS HE MISSUS MAGPIE I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU
8468-295198-0014 MY WIFE WAS ALL WELL ENOUGH CONTENT TILL OLD MOTHER MAGPIE INTERFERED IT IS QUITE MY DUTY TO TAKE STRONG GROUND AND SHOW THAT I CANNOT BE DICTATED TO
8580-287363-0006 LOOKING FROM AN AFTER WINDOW AND EVEN GOING OUT ON A SMALL OPEN PLATFORM BUT COULD DISCOVER NOTHING WRONG I GUESS RAD WAS JUST CAPERING ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL OBJECT MUSED TOM
8580-287364-0039 HOW YOU GOT ABOARD AND WHAT YOUR OBJECT WAS IN COMING THAT'S EASY ENOUGH I HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE SHED FOR SEVERAL DAYS WATCHING A CHANCE TO GET IN FINALLY I SAW IT WHEN THAT COLORED MAN WENT TO FEED HIS MULE AND I SLIPPED IN AND
8580-287364-0040 HID IN THE AIRSHIP THE STORES WERE ALL IN THEN AND I STOWED MYSELF AWAY AMONG THE BOXES I HAD FOOD AND WATER SO I DIDN'T TOUCH ANY OF YOURS AND HE LOOKED AT MISTER DAMON WHO SEEMED MUCH RELIEVED AND WHAT WAS YOUR OBJECT
8580-287364-0042 YOU MUST KEEP AWAY FROM THERE AND IF WE REFUSE ASKED TOM THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE WHAT COMES BUT NOT FROM YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER JENKS WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF YOU
8609-262281-0015 I HAVE SO MUCH TO TEACH YOU CAROLINE TO YOUR MIND AND HEART AS WELL AS TO YOUR INTELLECT THAT I FEEL THE HOURS AS AT PRESENT ARRANGED WILL BE INSUFFICIENT FOR ME MY DEAR WHEN YOU GROW UP TO WOMANHOOD I AM SURE YOU WILL WISH TO BE LOVING AND LOVED
8609-283227-0042 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0054 AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
8609-283227-0063 I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
8629-261139-0047 OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
8629-261140-0048 HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
8630-305212-0002 DISGUSTED HIM IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CONTENT TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THEIR COMPANY HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED WHEN THEY BOASTED OF THEIR MISDOINGS TO SEEM MORE INNOCENT THAN THEY
8630-305212-0007 KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0034 THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
87-121553-0007 IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
87-121553-0098 EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
8747-293952-0047 AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0064 BUT THE FACT OF CONNISTON LEAVING THE ARMY AND FROM DURHAM'S ATTITUDE I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE IS AND IN HIDING
8747-293952-0079 WOULD BE WRINKLED AND SINFUL HIS MIND WOULD HAVE MARKED PLAINLY ITS SIGNET ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE BUT AT PRESENT HE LOOKED CHARMINGLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT LIFE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM
8747-293952-0087 ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8770-295462-0004 HE DELIVERED AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE COMPARED WHITE SLAVERY WITH BLACK IN WHICH HE SAID AND WHEN THE VICTORY SHALL BE COMPLETE
8770-295462-0027 I WENT IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND THE HISTORIC WAR CABINET OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSEMBLED EVERY MEMBER BEING PRESENT THE PRESIDENT HARDLY NOTICED ME AS I CAME IN
8770-295463-0003 THE GREATEST GLORY OF GETTYSBURG LAY IN THE EXPERIENCES AND UTTERANCES OF ONE MAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE TIME IN THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0018 TO GARDNER'S GALLERY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAD PROMISED TO SIT FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH WHILE THERE HE SHOWED MISTER BROOKS A PROOF OF EVERETT'S ORATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM AS THIS PRINTED ADDRESS COVERED TWO NEWSPAPER PAGES
8770-295465-0006 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0019 MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
8770-295465-0022 IT SEEMED RIDICULOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ALLOW ANY CHILD TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT AND HAMPER HIM WHILE DELIVERING A GREAT ADDRESS WHICH WOULD WIELD A NATIONAL IF NOT WORLD WIDE INFLUENCE
8770-295465-0025 AND MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT OF THE LISTENING CROWD ON CONCLUDING HIS ADDRESS AND BIDDING THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE GOOD NIGHT HE TURNED TO THE SERENADING BAND AND SHOUTED JOYOUSLY GIVE US DIXIE BOYS PLAY DIXIE
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0059 BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0083 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0092 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8838-298545-0003 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST
8838-298545-0010 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
8838-298545-0012 FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
8838-298545-0015 THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
887-123289-0019 SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
887-123289-0021 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0039 IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0028 HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
89-218-0001 THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
89-218-0029 AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
89-219-0002 AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0007 FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0009 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0014 THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0023 BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
89-219-0027 THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0055 A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
8975-270782-0003 BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
8975-270782-0015 AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
8975-270782-0016 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0017 BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF THIS OCCUR IN LITERATURE AND I MYSELF CAN PRESENT SUCH AN EXAMPLE I ONCE DREAMED IN A CERTAIN CONNECTION OF A PERSON WHO MUST HAVE PERFORMED SOME SERVICE FOR ME AND WHOM I CLEARLY SAW HE WAS A ONE EYED MAN SHORT IN STATURE STOUT
8975-270782-0018 HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
8975-270782-0031 THAT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OR THAT THE LOVED PERSON SERVES AS A CONCEALING SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OTHER BUT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CALL FORTH ANOTHER MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION YOU SAY GRANTED THIS DEATH WISH WAS PRESENT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
8975-270782-0032 AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
8975-270782-0046 INTERESTING OBJECT AS A SORT OF LIVING DOLL AND IF THE DIFFERENCE IS EIGHT YEARS OR MORE MOTHERLY IMPULSES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF GIRLS MAY COME INTO PLAY BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL WHEN WE DISCLOSE IN A DREAM THE WISH FOR THE DEATH OF A MOTHER OR SISTER
8975-270782-0061 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0078 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0097 SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
8975-270782-0103 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
909-131041-0002 AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
909-131041-0007 WILL BE MUCH LESS APT TO CONVULSE THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY EXTRAORDINARY OR VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THAN THE CHOICE OF ONE WHO WAS HIMSELF TO BE THE FINAL OBJECT OF THE PUBLIC WISHES AND AS THE ELECTORS CHOSEN IN EACH STATE
909-131041-0021 AND THE PERSON WHO MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE THE PRESIDENT BUT AS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES MIGHT NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO CENTRE IN ONE MAN AND AS IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE TO PERMIT LESS THAN A MAJORITY TO BE CONCLUSIVE
909-131044-0008 THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
909-131044-0012 OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
909-131044-0013 IN WHICH A CONDUCT OF THIS KIND HAS SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM VERY FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES AND HAS PROCURED LASTING MONUMENTS OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE MEN WHO HAD COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM AT THE PERIL OF THEIR DISPLEASURE
909-131044-0023 THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
909-131044-0026 THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL IN WHICH THE PROSPECT OF ANNIHILATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE NOT TO HAVE AN IMPROPER EFFECT UPON THE CONDUCT OF A MAN INDUED WITH A TOLERABLE PORTION OF FORTITUDE
909-131045-0001 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0005 THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
909-131045-0010 THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
909-131045-0011 IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
909-131045-0019 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0026 TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
909-131045-0036 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
911-128684-0007 BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
911-128684-0009 ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
911-128684-0017 IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
911-128684-0032 AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
911-128684-0033 MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
911-128684-0036 WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
911-128684-0070 THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
